Glia quickly crossed the space before her and Dr. Bright, taking a moment to stare at the Doctor's heaving, panting form. There was a stillness between them. Dr. Bright riddled in burns and wounds didn't look long for this world, and Kaya seemed equally injured.

Jessica dropped her weapon. Then she lit her last cigarette and turned away, "Eh, fuck it. Not my fight." disinterested in intervening.

Malinda looked at Glia with awe and wonder. Her radiant beauty and ethereal form left her speechless. Though Jessica's cigarette made her nose wrinkle in disgust. She watched the scene play out in front of her, among the bloodied carpet, destroyed room, and numerous corpses.

Glia's voice had a resonance, a slight echo of itself when she talked. This unmistakable synthetic quality that it pop. "Do you regret any of this?" She said quietly.

Dr. Bright groaned, "I regret..." her eyes drooped, "I regret that I couldn't make it painless, but I'd have done it all again."

"Why would you say that?" Glia asked in a low whisper, "You know I can't let you leave now."

"I guess..." Dr. Bright laughed, "I guess at least that means we know you're hu—"

From Glia's chest a sharp needle of gel had shout out like a dart. It instantly penetrated both Dr. Bright's and Kaya's heads, and exploded into tiny whirring blades that instantly homogenized the brain into liquid. It was quick, painless, and horrifying.

Her hand turned into long flat piece of shrink warp that enveloped both their weapons then inflated. In the floating ooze the weapon was cleaned, disassembled, reassembled, and then loaded with a fresh magazine. Then when the orb turned back into a hand and the gun was moved somewhere inside of herself. The same way that Jess and Mal's stealth suits absorbed their weapons to holster them.

Glia slid over to Jess and Mal, and stuck out her hand for a handshake, "I appreciate you saving me." She was crisp, and put on affectations of formal business despite her words.

Jessica nodded, putting her cigarette in her mouth with her free hand. She shook, then when they disconnected took the cigarette out of her mouth. "Yeah, of course," she exhaled, "That's why we make the big bucks."

She had expected Glia's hand to be cold, and feel somewhat gooey or wet, instead it had a firm softness and a deep warmth. There was a slight rumble underneath her fingertips, as if she was petting a purring cat. She felt reassured and pleasant when they touched, and make note of the way she felt cold and alone when they parted. It wasn't a great sign.

Malinda shook in turn, and the effects were far more pronounced without the influence of combat stims. When they touched she felt feverish and flush, her mouth watered slightly, and immediately needed to take a deep breath. The rumble shook her throughout her body, and when they parted she felt distant. There was a mourning and a sense of loss that overtook her, and it nearly brought her to tears, though that feeling passed quickly.

"Holy shit, what are you made out of?" Malinda asked, "Uh, I'm Typewriter and that's Ink Ribbon."

Glia nodded, "Ok." Then she quirked her head quizzically, "Why Typewriter and Ink Ribbon?"

"We use our screen names for Bounty Blitz," Malinda responded, "It's better for optics and keeps some anonymity. Also helps you remember when it's time for a review."

"No, I mean..." She leaned in a little, "Why Typewriter and Ink Ribbon specifically?"

Jessica laughed, "You slide an Ink Ribbon into a Typewriter, and together, they create magic with every press and release."

Glia's gel darkened slightly, and she said, "Oh." in a tone that betrayed a bit of embarassment. "Do people still use Typewriters?"

With a raised eyebrow, Malinda said, "Some people do. Still retro I guess, and not that much slower then keyboards or touch screens." Then paused, "What's your synth-age?"

Glia stopped, "What do you mean? I'm programmed with simulated intelligence for a human in their lat twenties or early thirties. My physical form is to emulate a woman in that age range as well."

"Shit." Malinda said quietly. She hadn't liked that answer one bit, there were a few basics facts that AI had to go through when they were turned on. The difference between one with life experience, and one without was stark. You couldn't plop a fresh brain into a body without growing pains. "Synth-age is two numbers, but can just be a fraction for shorthand."

"Never thought we'd have to do this again," Jessica took another drag of her cigarette, "We're a bit grizzled for Synth-socializing."

"Quiet," Malinda hissed, "If you're an AGI like Fahz, you've got simulated memories. Those are what 'age' you're programmed for. They're basal, just a bunch of loose experiences, cause effects, and basic common sense to stop you from being taken advantage of. It's basically an almagamation of fake memories to make up a person. So you'll remember 'Oh yeah when I was in highschool,' but everytime you try to recall your time in High-school it'll be a different person's memory. It's not you yet, just a bunch of pieces that make up you. "

"Making an AI with simulated range out of adulthood gets you put in max-sec," Jessica added, "Body or mind. Completely unacceptable in every shape and form. You rarely last a day before someone shivs you."

"Why?" Glia looked at the two of them confused, then immediately caught on as she thought about it. "Oh... It's predatory..."

Malinda sat down at the computer and explained while she typed, "Not just that, but you've created something that can process terrabytes of data at a time, be actively malicious without morals, and has poor emotional regulation. A synth doesn't get full adult rights until they're 1.0 or later. Until then they have an appointed guardian."

"I don't know what my synth-age is." Glia said softly, but halfway through her next sentence emitted a loud staticy buzz. "I remember many years though. I have been re-written many times for te —bzzzt— purposes.""

"Twenty-eight twenty-five," The computer screen in front of Malinda glowed with a complete read out of bio-metric data. She quickly scanned through the documents, "Hey Fahz, can you get a copy of these? I'm assuming Glia would want them."

"Will do ma'am," Fahz replied, her tiny voice chipper.

"So you're one-point-thirteen, if some asks." Jessica flashed her a smile, "Way to go. You survived the Vornadine conflict."

"The what?" Glia asked confused.

She looked to Malinda, who responded with, "Fight for civil rights, android stabbed a senator for being a racist sack of shit. There was an attempted genocide, big ole war, buuunch of people died on both sides, and a planet got glassed. In the end, it became less profitable to keep fighting us so they buckled." 

Jessica leaned on Malinda's shoulder, her body felt heavy but she knew she had to press on. She said, "Typewriter means the ARB when she says us, we were part of the Android Rights Brigade. We... I guess you don't really enlist in a resistance. I met her mostly by chance on a mission. Then we met Fahz, and it was either help or do nothing." She stomped out her smoke, before leaning down and lifted the Gatling laser. Then she hefted it over her shoulder, "I guess you can tell by now we're not the do-nothing type."

Malinda rolled her eyes when Jessica gave Glia a wink. Still Jessica had done amazing today, she had earned a few minutes of showboating. She put her hand on the small of Jessica's back, and felt the other woman shudder beneath her touch. Mal wasn't quite sure if it was pain, love, or if her hands were just cold. She gave Jess a gentle push, prompting the three of them to walk down the hallway.

Her comms burst to life with Snake's voice, "Most of the facility is secured, but there's a problem."

"Two problems actually," Fahz cut in, "I'm sorry to say ma'am, but it looks like—" There was a loud buzz, some crackle of static, and a quiet pop, "Three problems now. CelestiaLabs AND BenzCorp have arrived. I'll let snake tell you about the other issue."

"Dr. Lane has holed himself up in the hangar bay. They have ships, we could get out, but not without taking out the CrabWalker. He's demanding the return of his Mother, and Kaya." Snake sounded morose.

All three of them, and the surrounding animal militia turned to stare back into the ruined office, where a litany of corpses lied, including Dr. Bright and Kaya. In a matter of hours, they had wiped out the entirety of Dr. Lane's surrounding friends and family.

Jessica whistled, then said, "Mom and a husband in one day. That's gotta suck." Blood bubbled at the corner of her mouth, and she vomited. Wet pink foam hit the linoleum with a moist splat. She coughed some more, and felt her self tilt slamming her shoulder into the wall to holder herself up. "<i>God damnit...</i>" She whispered. "I'm not feeling good Mal."

Alarm bells rang in Malinda's head. Jessica <i>never</i> admitted to being hurt. She only remembered one time she had gotten like this before, and that was on the leisure station when they had auctioned off the BenzCorp ceo. "Glia catch her!"

Jessica faded into a warm puddle of affection as she felt Glia's gel gently lift her. She was supported on a cloud, and the bubbling warmth trickled through her dull senses giving her a sense of peace. While she didn't want to die, there were worse ways to go she supposed. With an outreached hand, she felt Malinda grab it and smiled, shutting her eyes for the moment.

Frustration, anger, and despair broiled Malinda's core, and she kicked a corpse repeatedly with little grunts of rage. "Glia, what do you know about medicine and prosthetics?"

Glia paused for a moment, "I suppose... Everything necessary to install, test, and create them. I have the compilations of numerous texts on biology, surgery, diagnostic medicine, neuropathy—"

"Ok great, Snake, Jess needs surgery now."

"There's about thirty bombs on the roof" She paused and thought about how to use them.

[ ] - "Use them to mine the door ways and entry ways. Fahz can walk you through making detonators."
[ ] - "You can re-purpose them into handheld grenades with Fahz's help."
[ ] - "Leave them there, and when they land, blow the roof."

"Glia, you're coming with me. Congratulations, you've been promoted to head surgeon."

[ ] - "We need Jess up, running, and fighting. Focus on getting her awake."
[ ] - "Jess has done enough today, get all that broken shit off of her and just fix her like new. Keep her sedated or she's just going to run into the fight again."

"Fahz, open a comm-line," Mal said, as she threw her firey red curls into a pony-tail.

[ ] - "Let's see if we can try the same trick twice." Try to take Dr. Lane hostage, or at least lie about it, and trade him for safe passage on an open auction. "As for Lane, Snake that's on you, you're going to have to try and take him in alive."
[ ] - "Let's try and start a war." Bullshit both CelestiaLabs and BenzCorp that this is the fault of the other, trying to get their conflict started before they ever land. "As for Lane, ice him we don't need witnesses."
[ ] - "Let's see if we can get hired." Get either CelestiaLabs or BenzCorp to hire them, and assist in fending off the other. Hopefully with one enemy down, the other will be easier to fight. "As for Lane, ice him we don't need witnesses."
