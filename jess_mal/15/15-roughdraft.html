Biofoam plaster, was one part coagulant, one part repairitive nanite, one part destructive nanite, one part adhesive and ten parts expensive filler. A nozzled plunger jammed into wounds to stem bleeding and give the damaged enough time to get to the hospital. With a deep breath Jessica filled another bullet hole barely feeling the itch as the nanites ate away into the tungsten round lodged in her thigh. Then she took another deep puff of her Cig. She floated on the barriers of consciousness as she strained her senses to pay attention to Malinda.

"Tell the Client to just get down, fuck this, fuck these people. I'm done." Malinda snarled, exhausted.

Still, she had to accept they were lucky. She tried not to think how much slower, how much harder everything would have been if she spent more time outside haggling instead of taking advantage of the head start they had. She had placed her favorite gauss rifle on the ground, and was affixing recovered laser rifles to the plumbing pipe gatling's rotary device. Modifying the makeshift weapon to return it to it's original lethality.

Jessica exhaled through her nose, two giant geysers of smoke firing towards the ground. For a moment, she just stared at her hands. Her organic one, was caked with blood, scars, and callouses. While the stump where her cybernetic arm had been obliterated, was now a small round pedal housing. A piece of steel on a hinge that would allow her to work the laser gatlings rotary crank. This job fucking sucked. She stomped out her cigarrete, trying to obliterate it entirely.

She approached the door, and pneumatic servos in her leg whined as she put two small dents in ot. The bulkhead boomed.

"Hey, can you hear me?" She shouted.

[X] - Try empathy

A quiet voice replied, while soft it carried authority, and clarity. There was also a hard malice, like a blood-drenched diamond. "I am Dr. Bright, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?"

Jessica sighed, it was already going better than she had hoped, "My codename is Typewriter, I've been hired by the civilian detainees here to provide training, armaments, and support. How are you doing today?" She took note of the tiny speakers built into the sides of the door. Jessica could hear them clearly, because Dr. Bright chose to allow them to talk.

There was a snort from the other side of the door, "Civilian detainess? Surely you're joking. They're test subjects if I'm to be generous, or a militant force if I were to be accurate."

The cyborg started to stretch, rolling her shoulders, loosening her neck, feeling her servos stretch and vibrate with haptic feedback. "Yes, well, look at this from their side. One minute you're a scared cat or dog, the next minute you're a person trapped in a cat or dog's body. Someone did that to you, you're in a cage, and that person comes in to do worse. How would you react?"

"I'd start with asking them to stop!" Dr. Bright said with a cold sterness, "Normally a request is a good start."

"Oh come ON! Jessica, That's Bullshit!" Malinda picked up a jurry rigged explosive made out of power cells, affixing it to the wall. She was far beyond negotation, or trying to keep her malice contained, "I saw the benchmarks you were doing. Those 'prosthetics' were far too close to the limit for generalized intelligence. That was even the main program! It <i>was <b>monstrous</b></i> to continue without a more comprehensive assessment. Anyone with a spec of <i>fucâ€”</i>"

"INKRIBBON!" Jessica gripped Malinda's shoulder, her eyes were blazing coals, but her touch was gentle. A miniscule shake, to remind Malinda there were more important things at stake. "Go cool off. There was a break room right before this one."

Malinda's body language was clear, <i>Just kill them Jessica.</i>

She could see in Jessica's eyes the response, <i>We have to try this first.</i>

Malinda stormed off down the hallway to the breakroom, she took the explosives with her.

"Sorry about that, but yeah we've been fighting for about an hour now." Jessica continued, "And from what I understand your project was much more... Intimate with the people here." She heard the Doctor scoff again, "Ma'am, they're people. A lot struggle with that when it comes to synthesized intelligence, but it's a done-and-done debated fact. They're people, legally recognized for almost a decade. The prosthetic testing results makes it pretty clear you at least suspected they had reached generalized intelligence levels."

"Prosthetics? The head researcher, Dr. Lane! Did you meet him?" Dr. Bright whispered, "He's a rounder boy, my son. He's kind. He has a mustache. Do you know if he and his husband are safe?"

[X] Kill Brody (Brody Lane)

<i>Dr. Lane? Oh right, the guy in the mech...</i> Jessica nodded her head in case there was a camera, she tried to look comforting and empathetic, "Dr. Lane's fine ma'am. His husband didn't make it."

"That's going to be very unfortunate for you I'm afraid."

A larger, more brutish voice cut through. I was sharp, butch, and mixed with concrete. "Sorry to interrupt, but look at best, it's <i>a single</i> person. Collectively. We could make the argument that it's not even that."

"Alright, they still have rights though, but who is this I'm speaking to?" Jessica asked

"I'm Dr. Bright's research assistant, Kaya."

"Nice to meet you Kaya, maybe we can shake hands after we sort this business out." Jessica leaned on the bulkhead, "Ok, so we can agree whether they're a collective, or a group of individuals, they've got rights. They feel fear, pain, maybe some-day happiness."

There was a popping crackle over the speakers, it was Dr. Bright sighing over their microphone before saying, "It's inconclusive. In the grey zone, ma'am, this is bigger than <i>just</i> the animals here. Do you understand?"

Jessica thought she might, "Maybe, but we're having a pleasant conversation. Why not tell me anyways?"

"Some of the scores we got were abysmal, they wouldn't count as an AI, let alone a generalized intelligence like the androids or ship computers we have now. Everytime we give a new synthetic creation human rights, corporations can use it to make everything around us worse. They call them artists, creatives, that they should get to vote (the way their programmed too.) That they should get a chance to hold seats at the galactic senate." Dr. Bright continued, "If these things don't have free will, than we've just created something just good enough to fake it but will just do what they're told too."

Her assistant, Kaya tried to help, "We're not trying to torture these creatures alright? We need to come up with a better test. The current ones, the margin of error is too wide. We need to <i>know</i> they have free will."

That's pretty much what Jessica had figured out, in order to create a "fake" AI that could pass as a generalized intelligence they'd need precise testing to figure out if it would follow orders once it left their control.

Snake's voice cut through, it was low and threatening, "Tell them <i>how</i> you were figuring that out. The processes some of your new developed tests used."

Jessica heard the wheels of an office chair squeak, a pop of a bottle being openned, and the tinkle of a glass being filled with ice, then liquor, "Typewriter, have you seen the experiment instructions?"

"No, not yet, I assumed they were in there with you."

A gulp as Dr. Bright drained her drink, and filled a second one. "We've been transferring the carved micro-matrix crystals to smaller housings, and testing the difference in clarity, coherence, and performance. Then we restore from back-up."

Jessica whirled around in fear, checking the hallway to see if Malinda had heard what Dr. Bright said. She swore under her breath, <i>fucking monsters.</i> "Respectfully ma'am. What the fuck!?"

She thought about how Fahz explained to Malinda that a downgrade in an AGI's macro-matrix crystal is akin to dimensia. That just like binning with semiconductors, consistent production of macromatrix crystals was nearly impossible, and unless a crystal was a strict upgrade, their would be loss <i>somewhere.</i> A phantom pain, a constant light whisper, or maybe it manifests as a stutter, or maybe a psychosis. Every back up of a generalized intelligence required reading the data, and re-writing it into the new houssing. That always changed the initial bin. Rarely for the best. Upgrades or reproducing the original state was so rare, that an AGI  could be offline for years. Not only that, the tools needed to store petabytes of petabytes of data were so fine, nearly quantum, that concessions in permanence were made in all but the most expensive storage mediums. The memory cells degraded through read wear.

Everytime a generalized intelligence was restored from a backup they were chipped further. A break they'd have to accept. An incredibly complex traumatic experience that could only be compounded.

Fahz had some loss. The way she buzzed when loading, the loud bursts of static, forgetful moments, and times when she would freeze up. In fact, the only thing that seemed perfectly consistent was the core aspects of her. The way she loved every part of everybody. Her sense of humor. The things she read in her free time. The way she would pick and choose faces, genders, or personalities with care and enthusiasm. The way she wanted to highlight the perfect imperfection of being alive, to the point where she couldn't pick any one person to be, and toyed with the idea of being all of them.

Dr. Bright was forcing the intelligence here to repeatedly be damaged in a traumatic fashion.

"If I make it off this station without finishing my research," Dr. Bright's voice was steeled by unbreaking conviction, "I'll be serving multiple consecutive life sentences. I need to make this worth something."

"Ma'am, it's over." Jessica said plainly, "Either way, your experiments aren't going to continue. Dozens of personnel are dead, even more security forces, we've armed the majority of the animals. They've gotten even more weapons from the dead security. Just to get into this place, I had to fight a second set of mercs that were just going to level the entire building. None of this will be left standing." It was a <i>slight</i> embellishment, Steel was only one merc, but they did have to fight him twice.

"I <i>CAN'T!</i>" The Doctor roared in frustration, and slammed her desk. There was a scramble inside the room and Jessica heard the scraping of metal, breaking glass, and a bullet fired into her prosthetic leg.

[X] - Tell the client to get low, and light up the room.

"DO NOT DO THAT AGAIN, THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING!" Jessica roared, picking the gatling laser gun off the ground.

The crashing and fighting continued, another bullet, this time into the drop ceiling. A fluorescent bulb shattered, and the remaining started to flicker and flash.

"Fahz, tell the client to get down." Jessica roared.

"Ma'am, I don't have contact."

"Figure it the <i>fuck</i> out." Jessica started to charge the lasers on her gatling weapon, "GLIA, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME I'M OPENING FIRE."

There were more bangs, and Jessica hosed the door with laser fire. Malinda sprinted down the hallway with her explosive pack, placing it strategically at the base of the bulkhead. They both slowly walked back as the hot pink light show created streaks of melting steel.

"Detonating!" Malinda yelled, she waited a second and then whipped out her datapad, typing in parameters for the explosion, then confirming it.

Bright burning plasma incinerated steel with a small broiling pink globe of light. In only a moment it disappeared, vaporizing it's surroundings. The only thing evidence of it's existence was a three dimensional shilouhette of missing matter. Anything that was close to the orb was glowing white hot, with tiny globule motes of plasma rising into the air, like fireflies.

The explosion had knocked over multiple filing cabinets, and scattered paperwork around a carpeted office soggy with a mysterious blue fluid. The floor, now blood stained, had criss crossing yellow stripes, creating diamonds on a grey blue background. Each smeared wall had judges paneling, vertical ebony planks of wood that lead into a raised chair railing, with recessed horizontal planks beneath. About a quarter of the spacious office had been filled with a blue aquarium. The glass had been shattered, and the floor was covered with a viscous gel. Two guards with deep slashes laid crumpled in purple pools.

A tall muscular woman with short cropped black hair sat in the opposite corner. She wielded a giant silver pistol, but her unsteady grip caused it to wobble nervously, reflecting light around her. One eye was closed as blood seeped down her face, trickling over a square jaw onto a black A-shirt. Her baggy camo pants tucked into mid-calf combat boots were stained with dark splotches. Jessica noted this must be Kaya, and the combat knife strapped to her ankle.

Kaya was cradling what could only be Dr. Bright. Dr. Bright had silver hair that faded into a black ombre styled in a pixie cut. Her eyes were upswept slightly, without pupils, and digital patterns swept across them creating a pattern of blue with streams of gold. Dr. Brights chest heaved as air escaped her in ragged breaths, and her labcoat was covered in burns, char, and blood. 

Both of the women had been razed with Jessica's lasers.

"Stay back," Kaya demanded, and Jessica considered just blowing her away now to save herself the trouble later. She followed the woman's aim, and saw that Kaya wasn't pointing the weapon at her, or anyone on their side of the explosion. She was pointing it at the floor. Jessica couldn't see Glia anywhere, to be fair though, Jessica had never seen a biogenic android before, or knew what that might be. Fahz's attempts at explaining it were highly technical, and he too seemed lost on what might be possible, or how it might look.

Jessica turned to Malinda, "What the hell, I thought you were just going to blow the door?!"

Her partner shrugged, "This was the small payload, the other one was much much bigger. All the other stuff broken in here wasn't me."

Kaya fired into the gel, and it almost looked like the gel had retreated moments before the bullet had hit near it. <i>That can't be right,</i> Jessica thought. Then she got whoozy, and hissed. She pulled another combat-stim that she had recovered from security personnel and injected the hypo into her leg. A synthetic amphetamine analogue instantly brought her back, but each syringe was getting less and less effective.

"Glia, where is she?" Jessica asked, pointing the heavy laser Gatling at the two scientists on the floor. "Don't make me ask twice, it's bad for your health."

Kaya jerked her head to the aquarium, where a geyser of viscous gel was forming a work of art.

A tiny orb of light emerged from the depths, gently floating about five feet in the air. Globules rose from beneath it, forming an oval, then merged into sculpted, prominent cheekbones and a soft chin. Her skin glowed with tiny sparks of inner light that flickered in and out of existence. As she continued to take form, this light spread, leaving flowing, translucent bubbles in its wake. Her "hair" was made up of curling, spiral waterfalls that cascaded down to her shoulders, forming small flowing pools. Her irises, bright pink and expressive, were alight with fear and anger. Glia resembled a human in every way, but enhanced. A human photoshopped and edited in real life to meet perfection. As her formation completed, a colored texture, agreen pinstriped business suit, raised outwards from her center. Which she filled with a full, heavyset figure.

She extended her finger, and from it flowed any blood or debris her gel picked up during the transformation. Then, with a bright, clear voice, she said, "I'm leaving Kaya, and I won't allow you to hurt anyone else."

Kaya fired, and Glia's entire form shifted splitting apart into globules and re-forming. The gun clicked dry.

[ ] - "Glia, stop!" Jessica said stepping forward. (Jessica tries to talk Glia out of killing Kaya, and Dr. Bright.)
[ ] - "Glia, we're not killing people today." Jessica raised her weapon. (Jessica tries to talk Glia out of Killing Kaya, and Dr. Bright, and is willing to fight to do so.)
[ ] - "Eh, fuck it. Not my fight." Jessica lit her last cigarette, and turned her back. (Jessica let's them "handle" it.)
