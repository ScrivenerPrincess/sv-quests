Biofoam plaster was comprised of one part coagulant, one part reparative nanite, one part destructive nanite, one part adhesive, and ten parts expensive filler. It was a nozzled plunger, jammed into wounds to stem bleeding and buy the injured enough time to reach a hospital. With a deep breath, Jessica filled another bullet hole, barely feeling the itch as the nanites consumed the tungsten round lodged in her thigh. Then, taking another deep puff of her cig, she floated on the edges of consciousness, straining to pay attention to Malinda.

"Tell the client to just get down, fuck this, fuck these people. I'm done," Malinda snarled, exhausted.

Still, Malinda had to acknowledge they were lucky. She tried not to ponder how much slower, how much harder everything would have been had she lingered outside haggling instead of leveraging the head start they had. Her favorite gauss rifle lay on the ground, and she was busy attaching recovered laser rifles to the plumbing pipe gatling's rotary mechanism, modifying the makeshift weapon to restore its original lethality.

Jessica exhaled through her nose, two giant geysers of smoke billowing towards the ground. For a moment, she simply stared at her hands. Her organic one was caked with blood, scars, and callouses, while the stump where her cybernetic arm had been obliterated was now a small round pedal housing. This piece of steel on a hinge would enable her to operate the laser gatling's rotary crank. This job fucking sucked. She stamped out her cigarette, attempting to obliterate it entirely.

Approaching the door, pneumatic servos in her leg whined as she kicked two small dents in it. The bulkhead boomed.

"Hey, can you hear me?" she shouted.

[X] - Try empathy

A quiet voice replied. Soft yet carrying authority and clarity, it also held a hard malice, reminiscent of a blood-drenched diamond. "I am Dr. Bright. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?"

Jessica sighed, relieved that the conversation was already going better than she had hoped. "My codename is Typewriter. I've been hired by the civilian detainees here to provide training, armaments, and support. How are you doing today?" She noticed the tiny speakers built into the sides of the door, through which Dr. Bright's voice was clearly audible.

A snort came from the other side of the door. "Civilian detainees? Surely you're joking. They're test subjects if I were to be generous, or a militant force if I were to be accurate."

The cyborg began to stretch, rolling her shoulders and loosening her neck, feeling her servos stretch and vibrate with haptic feedback. "Yes, well, look at this from their side. One minute you're a scared cat or dog, the next you're a person trapped in a cat or dog's body. Someone did that to you, you're caged, and that person comes in to do worse. How would you react?"

"I'd start by asking them to stop!" Dr. Bright retorted with cold sternness. "Normally, a request is a good starting point."

"Oh, come ON, Jessica! That's bullshit!" Malinda exclaimed, affixing a jury-rigged explosive made from power cells to the wall. Her tone had shifted beyond negotiation, no longer containing her malice. "I saw the benchmarks you were doing. Those 'prosthetics' were dangerously close to the limits for generalized intelligence. And that wasn't even the main program! It <i>was <b>monstrous</b></i> to continue without a more comprehensive assessment. Anyone with a speck of <i>fuc—</i>"

"INKRIBBON!" Jessica interjected, gripping Malinda's shoulder. Her eyes blazed like coals, but her touch was gentle. A slight shake served as a reminder that more important things were at stake. "Go cool off. There was a break room right before this one."

Malinda's body language screamed a clear message: <i>Just kill them, Jessica.</i>

Yet in Jessica's eyes, the response was evident: <i>We have to try this first.</i>

Malinda stormed off down the hallway to the breakroom, explosives in tow.

"Sorry about that, but yeah, we've been fighting for about an hour now," Jessica continued, maintaining her composure. "And from what I understand, your project had a much more... intimate involvement with the people here." She heard the Doctor scoff again. "Ma'am, they're people. Many struggle to accept that when it comes to synthesized intelligence, but it's an established fact. They've been legally recognized as such for almost a decade. The prosthetic testing results seem to suggest you at least suspected they had reached generalized intelligence levels."

"Prosthetics? The head researcher, Dr. Lane! Did you meet him?" Dr. Bright's voice turned to a whisper, "He's a bit on the round side, my son. He's kind and has a mustache. Do you know if he and his husband are safe?"

[X] Kill Brody (Brody Lane)

<i>Dr. Lane? Oh, right, the guy in the mech...</i> Jessica nodded her head, assuming there might be a camera. She tried to appear comforting and empathetic. "Dr. Lane's fine, ma'am. But his husband didn't make it."

"That's going to be very unfortunate for you, I'm afraid."

A larger, more brutish voice suddenly cut in. It was sharp, butch, and mixed with the roughness of concrete. "Sorry to interrupt, but at best, it's <i>a single</i> person. Collectively. You could argue it's not even that."

"Alright, they still have rights though. But who is this I'm speaking to?" Jessica inquired.

"I'm Dr. Bright's research assistant, Kaya."

"Nice to meet you, Kaya. Maybe we can shake hands after we sort this business out," Jessica responded, leaning on the bulkhead. "Okay, so whether they're a collective or a group of individuals, we can agree they've got rights. They experience fear, pain, and maybe someday happiness."

A popping crackle came over the speakers, followed by Dr. Bright sighing into their microphone. "It's inconclusive. In the grey zone, ma'am. This is bigger than <i>just</i> the animals here. Do you understand?"

Jessica considered this. "Maybe, but we're having a pleasant conversation. Why not enlighten me?"

"Some of the scores we got were abysmal. They wouldn't qualify as AI, let alone a generalized intelligence like the androids or ship computers we have now. Every time we grant human rights to a new synthetic creation, corporations exploit it to worsen the world around us. They label them artists, creatives, saying they should vote (the way they're programmed to), that they deserve seats in the galactic senate." Dr. Bright continued, "If these beings lack free will, then we've created something just good enough to fake it, but that will still do what it's told."

Kaya, the assistant, chimed in, attempting to clarify, "We're not trying to torture these creatures, alright? We need to develop a better test. The current ones have too broad a margin of error. We need to <i>know</i> for certain if they possess free will."

That aligned with what Jessica had deduced: in order to create a "fake" AI that could convincingly mimic generalized intelligence, precise testing was essential to ensure it would follow orders outside their control.

Snake's voice then cut in, low and menacing. "Tell them <i>how</i> you were figuring that out. The processes some of your newly developed tests used."

The sound of an office chair squeaking, a bottle popping open, and the tinkle of ice being dropped into a glass, followed by the pour of liquor, filled the air. "Typewriter, have you reviewed the experiment instructions?" Dr. Bright asked.

"No, not yet. I assumed they were with you," Jessica replied.

There was the sound of a gulp as Dr. Bright drained her drink and poured a second one. "We've been transferring the carved micro-matrix crystals into smaller housings, testing for differences in clarity, coherence, and performance. Then we restore from backup."

Jessica spun around in alarm, quickly checking the hallway to see if Malinda had overheard Dr. Bright. She swore under her breath, <i>fucking monsters.</i> "Respectfully, ma'am. What the fuck!?"

Jessica reflected on Fahz's explanation to Malinda about how downgrading an AGI's macro-matrix crystal was akin to dementia. Like binning in semiconductors, consistent production of macromatrix crystals was nearly impossible. Unless a crystal was a strict upgrade, there would inevitably be loss <i>somewhere</i>. This loss might manifest as a phantom pain, a faint whisper, a stutter, or even psychosis. Every backup of a generalized intelligence entailed reading the data and rewriting it into the new housing, invariably altering the initial bin, rarely for the better. Such upgrades or reproductions of the original state were so rare that an AGI who chose to wait, could be offline for years.

Moreover, the tools required to store petabytes upon petabytes of data were so fine, almost quantum, that concessions in permanence were made in all but the most expensive storage mediums, leading to memory cell degradation through read wear.

Each time a generalized intelligence was restored from a backup, it was chipped away further, suffering a break it had to accept. This was an incredibly complex, traumatic experience, one that could only compound over time.

Fahz had shown signs of such loss: the buzzing sound when loading, loud bursts of static, forgetful moments, and instances of freezing up. Yet, the core aspects of her remained consistently intact – her love for every part of everybody, her sense of humor, the literature she enjoyed in her free time, her careful and enthusiastic choice of faces, genders, or personalities. She reveled in the perfect imperfection of being alive, to the extent that she couldn't settle on being just one person but toyed with the idea of embodying them all.

Dr. Bright, Jessica realized with a growing sense of horror, was subjecting the intelligence at the station to repeated, traumatic damage.

"If I make it off this station without finishing my research," Dr. Bright declared with a voice steel-hardened by unwavering conviction, "I'll be serving multiple consecutive life sentences. I need to make this worth something."

"Ma'am, it's over," Jessica stated plainly. "Either way, your experiments won't continue. Dozens of personnel are dead, along with even more security forces. We've armed the majority of the animals, and they've acquired more weapons from the fallen security. To even get here, I had to confront a second set of mercenaries intent on leveling the entire building. None of this will be left standing." This was a <i>slight</i> exaggeration; Steel was only one mercenary, but they had indeed faced him twice.

"I <i>CAN'T!</i>" Dr. Bright roared in frustration, slamming her desk. Inside the room, there was a scramble, followed by the scraping of metal, the sound of breaking glass, and a bullet hitting Jessica's prosthetic leg.

[X] - Tell the client to get low, and prepare to fire into the room.

"DO NOT DO THAT AGAIN! THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING!" Jessica shouted, lifting the gatling laser gun from the ground.

The chaos continued within, another bullet firing, this time hitting the drop ceiling. A fluorescent bulb shattered, causing the remaining lights to flicker and flash erratically.

"Fahz, tell the client to get down," Jessica ordered.

"Ma'am, I don't have contact," Fahz responded.

"Figure it the <i>fuck</i> out," Jessica snapped, beginning to charge the lasers on her gatling weapon. "GLIA, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, I'M OPENING FIRE."

More bangs erupted, and Jessica unleashed a barrage of laser fire at the door. Meanwhile, Malinda sprinted down the hallway with her explosive pack, placing it strategically at the base of the bulkhead. As they both slowly retreated, the hot pink light show from the gatling gun painted streaks of melting steel across the scene.

"Detonating!" Malinda called out. She paused for a brief moment before pulling out her datapad, swiftly typing in parameters for the explosion, and confirming the sequence.

A bright, burning plasma erupted, incinerating steel with a small, broiling pink globe of light. In an instant, it vanished, vaporizing its surroundings. The only evidence of its existence was a three-dimensional silhouette of missing matter. Anything close to the orb glowed white-hot, with tiny globules of plasma rising into the air like fireflies.

The explosion overturned multiple filing cabinets and scattered paperwork across a carpeted office, now damp with a mysterious blue fluid. The blood-stained floor was marked with crisscrossing yellow stripes, creating diamond patterns on a grey-blue background. Each smeared wall was adorned with judges' paneling, vertical ebony planks of wood leading to a raised chair railing with recessed horizontal planks beneath. Approximately a quarter of the spacious office had been occupied by a blue aquarium, its glass now shattered, covering the floor with a viscous gel. Two guards lay crumpled in purple pools, deep slashes evident on their bodies.

In the opposite corner sat a tall, muscular woman with short, cropped black hair, wielding a giant silver pistol. Her grip was unsteady, causing the pistol to wobble nervously, scattering light around her. Blood seeped down her face, closing one eye, and trickled over her square jaw onto a black A-shirt. Her baggy camo pants, tucked into mid-calf combat boots, bore dark splotches. Jessica quickly deduced this was Kaya, noting the combat knife strapped to her ankle.

Kaya cradled what appeared to be Dr. Bright. Dr. Bright had silver hair, fading into a black ombre and styled in a pixie cut. Her eyes, upswept and pupil-less, displayed digital patterns that swept across them, creating a mesmerizing pattern of blue with streams of gold. Dr. Bright's lab coat was covered in burns, char, and blood, and she struggled for air with ragged breaths. 

Both women had clearly been caught in the path of Jessica's laser fire.

"Stay back," Kaya demanded. Jessica briefly considered ending the confrontation right then to avoid future trouble. However, she noticed Kaya wasn't aiming her weapon at her or anyone on their side of the explosion. Instead, she pointed it at the floor. Jessica couldn't spot Glia anywhere; to be fair, she had never encountered a biogenic android before and had no idea what it might look like. Fahz's attempts to explain it had been highly technical, leaving even him uncertain about its potential appearance and capabilities.

Jessica turned to Malinda, exasperated. "What the hell, I thought you were just going to blow the door?!"

Her partner shrugged nonchalantly. "This was the small payload. The other one was much, much bigger. All the other damage in here? That wasn't me."

Kaya fired her pistol into the gel, and for a moment, it appeared as though the gel retreated just before the bullet struck. <i>That can't be right,</i> Jessica thought to herself. Suddenly feeling woozy, she hissed in discomfort. She pulled out another combat-stim, salvaged from security personnel, and injected the hypo into her leg. The synthetic amphetamine analogue instantly sharpened her senses, but each syringe was becoming less effective.

"Glia, where is she?" Jessica demanded, pointing the heavy laser gatling at the two scientists on the floor. "Don't make me ask twice. It's bad for your health."

Kaya, still holding her weapon, jerked her head towards the shattered aquarium, where a geyser of viscous gel was forming an otherworldly sculpture.

A tiny orb of light emerged from the depths of the gel, floating gently about five feet above the ground. Globules rose beneath it, forming an oval shape before merging into sculpted, prominent cheekbones and a soft chin. The skin of the emerging figure glowed with tiny sparks of inner light that flickered intermittently. As the formation continued, this light spread, leaving flowing, translucent bubbles in its wake. The "hair" was like curling, spiral waterfalls cascading down to the shoulders, forming small, flowing pools. Bright pink, expressive irises, alight with fear and anger, completed the visage. Glia resembled a human in every way, yet enhanced; a human photoshopped and edited in real life to achieve perfection. As her formation completed, a colored texture of a green pinstriped business suit emerged from her center, shaping into a full, heavyset figure.

She extended her finger, and from it flowed any blood or debris her gel had picked up during the transformation. Then, with a clear, resonant voice, Glia announced, "I'm leaving, Kaya, and I won't allow you to hurt anyone else."

Kaya fired her pistol, but Glia's form instantly shifted, splitting into globules and reforming, dodging the bullets. The gun clicked dry.

[ ] - "Glia, stop!" Jessica stepped forward, intent on deescalating the situation. (Jessica tries to talk Glia out of killing Kaya and Dr. Bright.)
[ ] - "Glia, we're not killing people today." Jessica raised her weapon, prepared to intervene if necessary. (Jessica attempts to prevent Glia from killing Kaya and Dr. Bright, ready to use force if needed.)
[ ] - "Eh, fuck it. Not my fight." Jessica lit her last cigarette and turned away, disinterested in intervening. (Jessica decides to let them "handle" the situation themselves.)
