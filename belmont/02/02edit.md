Bright lights, cheering crowds, wide eyes, anticipation. Deep breath.

*In. Out.*

First, her opponent is announced, "Thirty-five years old, weighing in at two hundred and forty-two pounds, standing six feet three inches tall. Born and raised right here in sunny Los Angeles. He has fifty-three wins and only twelve losses. The hometown hero, you know him, you love him, your champion Annnnnndy of Arlington!"

The loud whistle and crack of fireworks hurt the audience's ears and made ghouls in the distance flee. Loud cheers erupt from every direction as the floor of the aged octagon arena shook with the clamor of their stomping feet. The tiered stands threatened to collapse as the metal wearily protested against the excitement. Andy stood in the center of the ring with a wide grin, his mouthguard making his teeth look rotten and black. He had his hands raised in triumph as if he had already won.

He ran up the side of the chain-link fence to sit atop it and roared before jumping back in. Then he started shadow boxing an unseen opponent.

Andy bristled with muscle and hair. His physique was best described as "efficient." He had thick deltoids that connected to cord-like biceps. As he flexed, his muscles quivered, as if every inch was excited by the forthcoming violence. His kinky beard jutted out from his square jaw, and his slick ochre head caught the moonlight in the open arena. On his right arm, he had a tattoo of an American flag, with black and white stripes, the middle one blue.

"Annnd, his opponent, the up-and-comer, all the way from Arlen, Texas—" Boos erupted around the arena, the crowd already turning hostile, "A spry twenty-six years old, a giant wandering in at a staggering six foot two, weighing two hundred and thirty-eight pounds. The inglorious bastard, with fifteen wins and twelve losses. Patttyyyy BELMOOOOOONT!"

Patience rushed forward and shoulder-checked the thin chain-link door. It burst open, and she leapt in with a roar. Her hair was raven black, braided into a tight whip. She had tight bandages binding her chest under a fluorescent pink fight top. Her back was blasted with the Belmont family crest: a cross inside an upside-down shield, the symbol made with the negative space of two dragons. Her eyes were a deep dark brown, like the forest in autumn.

She roared to the booing crowd, delighting in their displeasure. Patience was unaware of Andy's eagerness to start until his fist connected with her lower jaw, snapping her head sideways. She stumbled for a moment as blows rained down on her. First her temple, then her orbital socket, then her kidneys, before coming back around to her jaw on the other side. It took her only a moment to recover; she took a half step back as Andy brought a fist low for another kidney punch. It didn't connect.

 With a yell, she grabbed his forearm and twisted it brutally before yanking him off balance. As he stumbled forward, she clasped the back of his head, bringing it into her knee. She felt him grapple her leg and swing it up to take her off balance. They both fell to the mat in the octagon.
    
He was on top of her as another flurry of strikes connected with her skull. Her head bounced off the canvas and plywood with every blow. Then, she swung back, a wild swing more defensive than offensive.

*QM Note: You do not start with a crit on a full-rest, this was the luck card drawn. Yes I'm sure I shuffled lol. The numbers don't always update properly, I may just remove the card counters and figure out a different way to show the discard.*## End Spoiler
    
The crowd exploded as the blow connected. Andy's eyes rolled back into his head as he — almost in slow motion — collapsed next to her. Andy had gone from fighter to rag doll in mere moments. A tiny bit of drool and blood created a small pool around his face, and his broken nose leaked profusely. Everyone was upset; the fight was over before it had even begun, and the wrong person won. Money changed hands in the background as the lucky few who had bet on Patience ran to their bookies.

A young redhead ran up with a bundle of clothes, a guitar on her back, and a pack of kretek to the ring. She was beyond skinny, reaching levels of 'twig' only achieved by trees, the famished, and stick bugs. There was an Irish brogue on her tongue as she spoke, "Fuck me, Pat, couldn't you have waited a minute? I didn't even get the time to finish my pretzel."

"Fiona, I swear I tried," Patience said as she took the cardboard box, and removed a slender clove cigarillo, "But apparently Andy had other ideas."

Fiona brought a freckled hand up to Patience's face as the other leaned down to light her cig. The smell of clove oils, cinnamon, and tobacco filled the air.

Patience took a deep breath, and then exhaled sugary sweet smoke. "We need to get out of here, like now. The Blue-Boys are going to be pissed."

"When *isn't* the LAPD pissed?" Fiona said, but she picked up the pace nonetheless.

As they moved, Fiona handed Patience clothing. In minutes, the larger of the two was wearing thick, scuffed leather, steel-toed boots that laced up to her knees, with chains, belts, and laces crisscrossing around her calves. Those lay over loose black denim jeans leading to a fabric belt with a large buckle shaped like a bull's head. She wore a loose tank top with a red A in a circle emblazoned on it, then over that, she wore a denim jacket covered in various patches and signatures written in multi-colored inks. The scars on her knuckles were covered with fingerless gloves, and finally, she threw a gold chain with an ankh around her neck.

The arena was in the parking lot behind an old nightclub called "Sapphire." Sapphire had previously been an old Cocost before it was renovated. The cement floors were spray-painted with murals, and the kitchen, which once sold cheap pizza and hotdogs, now had an expanded menu: watered-down liquor, cheap pizza, and hotdogs. A stage had been placed in the center, and dining tables were scattered throughout. The old PA system blared music as people danced in the night.

Patience and Fiona rushed past the crowds to the back, pushing their way through to the manager's office, which was cut into the side. They ran past private rooms with pink lighting and passed out addicts, as thumping bass reverberated off the cheap thin walls. A motel with rooms that rented by the hour had been built into the warehouse. Small groups of people, in various configurations of gender and undress traveled with hushed whispers through the hallways.  Despite everything that had happened in America, Los Angeles was still Los Angeles.

When they reached the back, Pat's fist nearly tore the door off its hinges as she banged on it. A piece of paper had been stapled to it at head height that said in scrawling cursive, "CEO of Sapphire: Shoresy Laroux."

"Shoresy, open up. I need my money, man, now," she yelled.

The door swung wide as a short, rotund man with horn-rimmed glasses and white hair gave them both a withering glare. Shoresy had the complexion of mottled ham and an equally charming temperament. With a speed that didn't match his corpulence, he snatched the clove cig from Patience's mouth and threw it on the ground, stomping on it with cheap off-brand snakeskin loafers. He sneered at her. His thin hairline mustache curled to reveal yellowing teeth and a single canine gilded with gold.

"Patience, how are you done so fast?! You know I pay you for a show, right?" His voice was cold and greasy, like fast-food fryers in the morning. "What the hell happened?!"

"Andy has a glass jaw is what happened. I gave him a love tap and he passed out," Patience said. "You pay me to win, Shoresy. I won, I want my cash."

"Yeah yeah," the aging manager said as he waddled over to the safe behind his desk. "You know the Blue-Boys are going to skin you alive when they find out you made Andy look like a punk."

Mr. Laroux's office was opulent; the walls were covered in red felt, and a single bear-skin rug sat between giant upholstered love seats. His desk was made of solid lacquered redwood, with a green felt desk mat that lay over it. A triceratops fossil display — stolen from the Natural History Museum — had been reconstructed behind the desk. It dwarfed the room, as its long bony tail was wired to wrap around the back wall.

"Yeah, we *know* Shoresy," Patience gave the man an indignant snort. "That's why we've gotta split before they find out."

Shoresy popped open a safe and handed Patience two hundred and fifty Canadian dollars. American money had long become worthless. The various black markets that still smuggled into the country could do nothing with it, as a dead nation was unable to back a currency. Now dollars and cents were used for fires and ammo. Dracula had made sure the rest of the world had weaned off the American economy before he tore it asunder.

"Kid, before you go," Shoresy plopped into his overly plush armchair, a lay-Z-boy on wheels, "You got a minute?"

Patience crammed the money into her back pocket, then shot a quick, furtive glance at Fiona. "Yeah? What's up?"

***[X] Special Event - Crit on Pit-Fight (Patience has time to talk.) - A chance to save Shoresy.***

"Listen, I got this problem," he rubbed the back of his neck. "Her name's Monica. I—"

"I don't kill people for money; we've talked about this," Patience groaned, as she marched towards the door.

Mr. Laroux raised his voice, "No, it's not like that, Pat! She's my kid, alright? She's gotten into some trouble. I'll pay; I know you need the scratch."

It was Fiona who spoke next, "Alrighty then, what's this Monica gotten herself into?"

"She won't say. She won't return my calls anymore either. Last I saw her, she was as pale as a ghost and had some track marks on her wrist. At least that's what she told me but uh..." Shoresy put his elbows on his desk and stared off into the distance. "Only she ain't the type, and I've been around enough tweakers to know what track marks look like."

"*Shit.*" Fiona said quietly.

"Yeah, exactly." He didn't break eye contact with the wall as he spoke. "If there's a vampire in LA, that's a big fuckin' problem, yeah?"

Patience nodded, "Yeah. To say the least. When was the last time you spoke?"

"About a month ago," Shoresy replied. "I hired a guy to keep an eye on her; he was supposed to call me every day. He ain't called in a week. Pretty sure he's dead; someone found his Nikola rolled in the river."

Nikolas were electric vehicles famous for catching fire with the occupants locked inside. With gasoline expiring every three to six months, and most supply lines majorly disrupted, electric vehicles were the only thing still reliably running. Especially as a power-starved California was cut off from its fossil-fuel supplies in other states. While its ambitious plan to be 100% renewable by 2045 was cut short by Dracula, it still pulled ahead enough to be largely self-sufficient outside of Diesel. Partly thanks to the massive slaughter by Dracula's forces, and the multitudes of homes lost in the yearly fires, the two combined freeing up much-needed bandwidth on the aging power grid.

Shoresy took out a business card and wrote down a quick address. "She's in Silverlake, here," he held his hand out, and Fiona picked up the card. "I'll give you two fifty up front, and another one twenty-five when you find her. Then, if you gotta uh..." He gulped. "You know, if you gotta do your Belmont thing or when you bring her back, another one twenty-five."

There was a whoosh, and Patience had an odd shiver creep up her spine. She couldn't shake the goosebumps, and her ears strained to hear something that wasn't there. It was nothing, she realized, and then that realization turned into hard lead in her stomach. She heard *nothing*—no music, no cheers, dancing, moans, or echoing laughter. The *entire club* had gone dead silent.
