    Game: Castlevania: Lament of Innocence — 1094 A.D.

The 11th century was a time of knighthood, when the medieval monarchs were waning due to feuding lords and knights. Two of the courageous knights fighting during this period were Leon Belmont and Mathias Cronqvist, who together with Leon's exceptional combat experience and Mathias' skills as a tactician led one of the strongest companies in the realm. Walter Bernhard was a powerful vampire who lived in a castle within a forest covered in eternal darkness. One day, Leon's fiancée, Sara, is kidnapped by this very vampire. Leon renounces his loyalty to the Church in order to save her. In the end, in order to avenge his fiancée's death, he manages to defeat Walter with the Vampire Killer Whip, created from Sara's soul. However, everything was just a plot by Leon's close friend Mathias, who had turned into a vampire in order to defy God, who allowed his wife to die of an illness.[3]
12th-14th centuries

With Leon now walking the path of a Vampire Hunter in pursuit of Mathias, the Belmonts' eternal struggle against evil begins. From generation to generation, the Vampire Killer and the title of Vampire Hunter is passed down. Feared for their powers, they are shunned by society at large and lived in exile. What they also did not realize was that each foe slain only added to the power of Mathias. Meanwhile, Mathias leads a peaceful existence during this time[4] but, growing more powerful over the years, he eventually declares himself King of the Night and changes his name to Dracula Vlad Ţepeş. He continued to hide in foreign lands, biding his time for when he would unleash his dreadful power upon the world.[5]

Though defeated at the hands of Trevor Belmont, Dracula's curse still ravages the countryside of Europe, bringing with it disease, mob violence and heresy. Amidst this chaos is Hector, a Devil Forgemaster who had formerly worked in the service of Dracula. Yet Hector grew weary and disgusted with the Count's brutal methods and left to live with humans. When his human wife was killed and his fellow forgemaster, Isaac, is implicated in the deed, Hector sets off for Dracula's stronghold to settle the score with him. At the end, it is revealed that Isaac made Hector regain his devil forging powers so that Dracula's Castle would return to the human world. Unbeknownst to Isaac, he himself was being used by Death, Dracula's right-hand-man, as a vessel for his master's reincarnation. Death believed that Hector would kill Isaac and that Dracula's Curse would take control of him, with his body becoming a vessel for Dracula's safe return to Earth. However, Hector realized that his drive for vengeance was caused by Dracula's Curse and resolved that he would no longer be manipulated. Hector did not kill Isaac, which prompted Death to use Isaac's body as an alternative. Hector killed his former master and performed the "Final Forging" where he summoned the essence of the curse and destroyed it. But the mysterious Saint Germain, whom Hector had met earlier, believed that the war will never end and even when all evil is destroyed, there will still be those who will claim evil's mantle again.
