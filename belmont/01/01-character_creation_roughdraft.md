This quest uses two decks of playing cards divided into Belmont Skill Decks, and Fate Challenge Decks to resolve challenges, with each suit representing a different skill. When a choice is chosen, a skill card is compared to a challenge card. If the Skill card is Higher or Equivalent to the Challenge Card, the task succeeds. This is the core mechanic of the game, all other rules, abilities, and modifiers revolve around this core resolution mechanic.

Character creation and progression will come from attaching abilities to cards, gaining abilities, and modifying both The Belmont's deck, The Luck Deck and Fate's Deck. 

If you are the type to learn by reading, I have tried to create a very thorough rule document. I do not believe the system is complicated, but I did want to be thorough, which ended up being very verbose.

If you are the the type to learn by example, skip ahead to examples which are written with the assumption you did not read the rule document.

Here are all the parts of the system:

![[/belmont/tutorial_01.png">

<h3>Suits to Skills</h3><ul><li>**Clubs** - represent *sharp* this works as both technical skill and specialized intelligence. Engineering, Deal-making, Lockpicking, noticing details,and fighting with a gun are all under sharp.</li>
<li>**Spades** - represent *Brawn* this works as both physical athleticism and general willpower. Researching, intimidating, running, using The Belmont's looks, and fighting with an axe are all under Brawn.</li>
<li>**Hearts** - represent *Heart* this works as both emotional intelligence, and overall stamina. Counseling, consoling, holding The Belmont's breath, going without food, and fighting with a whip are all under Heart</li>
<li>**Diamonds** - represent *Magic* this is your casting ability, and is used for general casting, but also as a resource for any special abilities that The Belmont may obtain on their journey.</li></ul>

The Token represents the discard pile, and will be placed on the deck when it's on it's *last card*.

Each card on the Belmont side is called a *skill card* Belmont's decks are *skill decks.* Collectively they belong to Belmont.

Each card on Fate's side is called a *challenge card* Fate's decks are called *challenge decks.* Collectively they belong to Fate.

The card's at the top are on Luck's side, each one is a *luck card* Luck's deck is called the *luck deck.* Collectively they belong to Luck.

You, reader, are the *audience*, no cards belong to you *yet.*

<h3>Task Resolution</h3> To succeed in a task, The Belmont's skill card after Luck bonuses are applied, must meet or exceed the revealed challenge card from Fate's appropriate skill deck. In most cases, the skill cards the audience chooses from will be revealed, while the challenge cards in the challenge decks will be hidden. Discard piles will be public knowledge, and shown next to each respective deck.

A task fails when the skill card's value after bonuses and maluses is lower than the challenge card. A task also fails if the last card in a deck is chosen. When a task is failed, an Ace gets placed on the top of the deck, guaranteeing a success the next time that skill is chosen.

If the Luck Card suit matches the suit of the chosen skill card, it counts as one card higher.

If the number matches, it counts as two cards higher.

If both match, the card counts as an auto-success. Even in instances where victory would be impossible.

Bonuses are applied in the order of Sharp, Brawn, Heart, Magic, and then Luck. Bonuses do not follow any other order of operations.

Maluses are applied after Bonuses

<h3>Deck Configurations</h3> Belmont and Fate has their respective cards split into 4 decks, seperated by suit.

The Belmont starts with 8 cards per skill deck, a 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.

Fate starts with the same per challenge deck, but only contains a 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. 

The luck deck contains a copy of every card from each of Belmont's skill deck. Any modifications The Belmont makes to their deck, also effects the luck deck.

*Author's Note: Notice that Belmont has a 7 and 8, that means that Belmont will **almost always** lose on those cards, as 7 or 8 will not meet or beat a 9 on it's own.*

Let's do a few examples of play, and situations that might come up. First, a scenario is dictated in which failure is possible.

[...]
"Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!" Richter roared, fist tightening on his whip.

The lavish throne room was dim, and chilly. The candles flickered in the pale moonlight as Dracula stood his full height. He stared into his wine glass, ignoring Richter entirely, "What is a man?" He whispered, then in rage he slammed his wine glass against the wall sending glass everywhere.

"A miserable little pile of secrets! But enought talk! Have at you!" Then lunges at Richter with undead fury.

In response Richter

[ ] - Sharp 7 - Rolls beneath the Count easily dodging his wrath.
[ ] - Brawn 10 - Coils his whip around his fist punching Dracula in the face
[ ] - Heart 8 (LUCKY! CRITICAL SUCCESS!) - Unleashes his whip, and quickly wraps it around the creature's throat.
[ ] - Magic K - Summon Holy Water to crash down on the foul count.

![[/belmont/tutorial_02.png">

The audience's highest card on the table is the Magic King, so it would stand at a quick glance, that that would be a good play. And the vote goes thusly:

[ X ] - Magic K - Summon Holy Water to crash down on the foul count.

![[/belmont/tutorial_03.png">

**K > 9 - SUCCESS!**

Richter stood his ground, and pulled out a crucifix. A thin beam of holy water connected with the count his skin bubbling under the radiant torrent.

Good job Richter! 

But there are a few other ways this could have gone, what if Richter had picked:

[ X ] - Sharp 7 - Rolls beneath the Count easily dodging his wrath.

![[/belmont/tutorial_04.png">

**7 < 9 - FAILURE! Reshuffle decks!**

Richter rolls low, and catches Dracula's knee with his teeth. He's flung backwards, and smashes against the stone wall. Blood dripped from his broken nose as he readied himself for more violence.

**Shuffling - placing an Ace on top of the deck. **
<img scr="/belmont/tutorial_05.png">

Ah, right, sorry Richter. I forgot to warn the audience! The Fate deck, contains a 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. That means that in almost every situation, a Belmont's 7, or 8 would mean failure. This could be a good thing, as Richter's Ace of clubs is now back in play!

We should note though, that Luck is always on Belmont's side.

[ X ] - Heart 8 (LUCKY! CRITICAL SUCCESS!) - Unleashes his whip, and quickly wraps it around the creature's throat.

![[/belmont/tutorial_06.png">

**LUCKY! Matching Suit and Number! Critical Success!**

Richter lashes out with his whip trying to wrap it around the creature's throat. Holy light surges through it's blessed threads, and instead he cleanly severs Dracula's head from his body. The count's corpse rolls with unerring ease, as a demon's visage starts to grow from the new hole. The first phase of the fight is complete, but the battle is far from over...

**Shuffling - placing an Ace on top of the deck.**
![[/belmont/tutorial_07.png">

Normally, emptying Fate's challenge deck would trigger an automatic failure, but due to Luck matching both Suit, and Number of the chosen skill card, this results in a critical success. A critical success can never be defeated. Instead, the cards are shuffled,  and an Ace is placed ontop of the Heart Skill Deck *as if* they failed the check. This would be a rare case to come up, but I thought I'd cover it.
