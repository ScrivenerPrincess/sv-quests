This quest uses two decks of playing cards divided into Belmont Skill Decks and Fate Challenge Decks to resolve challenges, with each suit representing a different skill. When a choice is made, a skill card is compared to a challenge card. If the Skill card is Higher or Equal to the Challenge Card, the task succeeds. This is the core mechanic of the game; all other rules, abilities, and modifiers revolve around this core resolution mechanic.

Character creation and progression come from attaching abilities to cards, gaining abilities, and modifying both The Belmont's deck and Fate's Deck.

If you are the type to learn by reading, I have tried to create a very thorough rule document. I do not believe the system is complicated, but I did want to be thorough, which ended up being very verbose.

If you are the type to learn by example, skip ahead to the examples, which are written with the assumption you did not read the rule document.

Here is the rule codex:

[SPOILER="GLOSSARY"]

[h3]Suits to Skills[/h3]
[LIST]
[*][B]Clubs[/B] - represent [I]sharp[/I]; this works as both technical skill and specialized intelligence. Engineering, deal-making, lockpicking, noticing details, and fighting with a gun are all under sharp.
[*][B]Spades[/B] - represent [I]Brawn[/I]; this works as both physical athleticism and general willpower. Researching, intimidating, running, using The Belmont's looks, and fighting with an axe are all under Brawn.
[*][B]Hearts[/B] - represent [I]Heart[/I]; this works as both emotional intelligence and overall stamina. Counseling, consoling, holding The Belmont's breath, going without food, and fighting with a whip are all under Heart.
[*][B]Diamonds[/B] - represent [I]Magic[/I]; This is your casting ability and is used for general casting, but also as a resource for any special abilities that The Belmont may obtain on their journey.
[/LIST]

The Token represents the discard pile and will be placed on the deck when it's on its [I]last card[/I].

Each card on Belmont's side is called a [I]skill card[/I]. Belmont's decks are [I]skill decks.[/I] Collectively they belong to Belmont.

Each card on Fate's side is called a [I]challenge card[/I]. Fate's decks are called [I]challenge decks.[/I] Collectively they belong to Fate.

The card at the top is on Luck's side, each one is a [I]luck card[/I]. Luck's deck is called the [I]luck deck.[/I] Collectively they belong to Luck.

You, the reader, are the [I]audience[/I]. No cards belong to you [I]yet.[/I]
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER="Task Resolution"]
[h3]Task Resolution[/h3]
To succeed in a task, The Belmont's skill card value, after Luck bonuses are applied, must meet or exceed the revealed challenge card value from Fate's appropriate challenge deck. In most cases, the skill cards the audience chooses from will be revealed at the time of voting, while the challenge cards in the challenge decks will be hidden. Discard piles will be public knowledge and shown next to each respective deck.

A task fails when the skill card's value, after bonuses and maluses, is lower than the challenge card. A task also fails if the last card in a deck is chosen. When a task is failed, an Ace gets placed on the top of the related skill deck (or decks), guaranteeing success the next time that skill is chosen.

If the Luck Card suit matches the suit of the chosen skill card, it counts as one card higher.

If the value matches, it counts as two cards higher.

If both match, the card counts as an auto-success, even in instances where victory would be impossible.

Bonuses are applied in the order of Sharp, Brawn, Heart, Magic, and then Luck. Bonuses do not follow any other order of operations.

Maluses are applied after Bonuses.
[/SPOILER]
[SPOILER="Deck Configurations"]
[h3]Deck Configurations[/h3]
Belmont and Fate have their respective cards split into 4 decks, separated by suit.

The Belmont starts with 8 cards per skill deck: a 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.

Fate starts with the same per challenge deck but only contains a 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.

The luck deck contains a copy of every card from each of Belmont's skill decks. Any modifications The Belmont makes to their deck also affect the luck deck.

[I]Author's Note: Notice that Belmont has a 7 and 8, meaning that Belmont will [B]almost always[/B] lose on those cards, as a 7 or 8 will not meet or beat a 9 on its own.[/I]
[/SPOILER][/SPOILER]

[SPOILER="That seems boring as hell, can you just show me?"]

Sure! Let's do a few examples of play and situations that might come up. First, a scenario is dictated in which failure is possible.

[...]
"Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you!" Richter roared, his fist tightening on his whip.

The lavish throne room was dim and chilly. The candles flickered in the pale moonlight as Dracula stood to his full height. He stared into his wine glass, ignoring Richter entirely. "What is a man?" he whispered. Then, in a rage, he slammed his wine glass against the wall, sending glass everywhere.

"A miserable little pile of secrets! But enough talk! Have at you!" Then he lunges at Richter with undead fury.

In response, Richter
[I]Lucky, 8 of Hearts[/I]
[ ] - Sharp 7 - Rolls beneath the Count, easily dodging his wrath.
[ ] - Brawn 10 - Coils his whip around his fist, punching Dracula in the face.
[ ] - Heart 8 (LUCKY! CRITICAL SUCCESS!) - Unleashes his whip and quickly wraps it around the creature's throat.
[ ] - Magic K - Summons Holy Water to crash down on the foul count.

[SPOILER="======>Board State<======"]

[/SPOILER]

The audience's highest card on the table is the Magic King, so at a quick glance, that would be a good play.

[SPOILER="[ X ] - Magic K - Summon Holy Water to crash down on the foul count."]

[/SPOILER]

[B]K > 9 - SUCCESS![/B]

Richter stood his ground and pulled out a crucifix. A thin beam of holy water connected with the count, his skin bubbling under the radiant torrent.
[/SPOILER]

Good job, Richter! You get 'em!

But there are a few other ways this could have gone. What if Richter had picked Sharp?

[SPOILER="[ X ] - Sharp 7 - Rolls beneath the Count, easily dodging his wrath."]
[SPOILER="RESULTS"]

[/SPOILER]
[B]7 < 9 - FAILURE! Reshuffle decks![/B]

Richter rolls low and catches Dracula's knee with his teeth. He's flung backward and smashes against the stone wall. Blood drips from his broken nose as he readies himself for more violence.
[SPOILER="[B]Shuffling - placing an Ace on top of the deck.[/B]"]

[/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]

Ah, right, sorry Richter. I forgot! The Fate deck contains a 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A. That means that in almost every situation, a Belmont's 7 or 8 would mean failure. This could be a good thing, as Richter's Ace of clubs is now prepared for his next skill check!

We should note, though, that Luck is always on Belmont's side. Let's see how that rather complicated Heart action would play out.

[SPOILER="[ X ] - Heart 8 (LUCKY! CRITICAL SUCCESS!) - Unleashes his whip and quickly wraps it around the creature's throat."]
[SPOILER="RESULTS"]

[/SPOILER]
[B]LUCKY! Matching Suit and Number! Critical Success![/B]

Richter lashes out with his whip, trying to wrap it around the creature's throat. Holy light surges through its blessed threads, and instead, he cleanly severs Dracula's head from his body. The count's corpse rolls with unerring ease, as a demon's visage starts to grow from the new hole. The first phase of the fight is complete, but the battle is far from over...

[SPOILER="[B]Shuffling - placing an Ace on top of the deck.[/B]"]

[/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]
Normally, emptying Fate's challenge deck would trigger an automatic failure, but due to Luck matching both the Suit and Number of the chosen skill card, this results in a critical success. A critical success can never be defeated. Instead, the cards are shuffled, and an Ace is placed on top of the Heart Skill Deck [I]as if[/I] they failed the check. This would be a rare case to come up, but I thought I'd cover it.
