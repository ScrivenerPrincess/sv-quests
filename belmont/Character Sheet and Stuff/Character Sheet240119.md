<u>Brawn Failure Trigger: Draw 1 (Exhaust)</u>

*If triggered, discard an additional Brawn Skill Card and pass the skill check instead. Add an exhaustion token to the Brawn Skill Deck until it is reset. This effect cannot be activated on the Brawn Skill Deck if it already has an exhaustion token. The effect does not activate if there is no card to draw, or only one card, as it would still result in a failure. This effect does not prevent failures from the last card being drawn in the Skill or Challenge decks.*

Armor: Denim Jacket
### Denim Jacket
**Denim Jacket**

### Arifacts
#### Artifact: Beloved Drawing
**Beloved Drawing**

A drawing depicting Mr. Shoresy Laroux, Ms. Monica Laroux, and Ms. Isabella Fernandez (once Isabella Laroux). On the back, a giant smiley face says, "Happy Birthday Dad, I love you!" The paper is warm to the touch, as if left in the sun, even in the coldest room.

### Inventory
#### Weapon: Belmont Guitar
**Belmont Guitar**

A gift to Patience from her mother. This wicked axe has been modified to also function as an electric guitar. The body of the guitar is a gleaming blade adorned with a laughing imp, where the guitar strings terminate in the imp's mouth, and flames crawl up its sides. The fretboard, stock, and head form a giant crucifix, with the thorns on the crown of the savior's head acting as tuners for the strings. Red paint trails from the savior's crucifixion down to the flames below.
