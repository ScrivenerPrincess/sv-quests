"Patience, the feck are you doing?" Fiona said, keeping her eyes on the road.

Patience had turned herself a complete one-eighty in the passenger's seat. She half knelt into the seat, and half sat on the dashboard. The back of the seat had been almost entirely leaned back, and she was throwing around luggage, blankets, and empty bottles as she searched the back-seats. Her hand darted under cushions, into the pockets of the doors, and through the creases of the seats.

"I don't know really," She replied, "I wanted to have a quick look around, see if there's anything we could snatch while we're in here."

"Well, would you kindly stop? You're shaking the entire truck, and I'm going almost a hundred." For how fast Fiona was going, the ride was surprisingly smooth, though that seemed more in spite of the overpriced truck than because it. They were racing along the I-10 the electric engine whirring with artificial noise to warn pedestrians of it's coming. They were using the elevated freeways to pass between the various safe zones that had been carved out of the city.

Patience huffed, and whipped back around plopping into her seat with a loud whoomph. "I'm sorry! it's <i>boring</i> to sit in a car. You can't stretch your legs," She started to dig around under her seat, "I'm getting wiggly. Wait I found something!" From underneath herself, she triumphantly pulled out a glass bottle with a strip of packaging tape on the front. "Jack-pot!"

<my-spoiler name="Use Immediately: Mailie Malibu Rum">
    <b>Mailie Malibu Rum</b>

    A clear bottle of cloudy rum, it smells strongly of artificial coconut. The makeshift label was marked with a rubber stamp of a cartoon cat's face winking. Patience's favorite.

    <u>Use Immediately, Then Discard</u>

"Great, you found something now... Just sit still! It hasn't even been ten minutes yet." Fiona could feel a migraine coming on, "I forgot how hard it is to drive anywhere with you. Just stop being a baby! You'd have hated here before the fall."

"Why's that?" The scent of coconut rum filled the air as Patience popped the cork open and started to chug.

Fiona laughed, "Traffic o'course, it'd take my da about an hour to get ten miles on this motorway." She slowed the vehicle down as rows of scrap metal pallisades made out of staggering towers of vehicles lined their path.

The protective wall had been built to keep Night Creatures out from people who may be traveling. Though now, some cars had fallen off of their twenty foot high stakes, and littered the freeway. Burnt out warehouses fell away beneath them as the freeway bridged over a disgusting line of filth, the infamous Los Angeles River, a now defunct channel of sludge. Before the fall, it had been fed with discharged wastewater from sewage treatment plants, and even now when it rained the fetid streets dumped detritus into it. Parts of the River had started to flood with stagnant sludge, as walls of discarded cars and plastic choked it anywhere it narrowed.

Patience finished her rum, as they drove around the collapsed vehicles, and threw the bottle out of the window. She heard it shatter against something, and looked out between the crushed warehouses, "Hey Fiona stop for a sec."

"Are you sure? It's not exactly the safest place for a walk." Fiona responded, but she stopped the car anyways.

Patience opened the door, and climbed one of the cars. It wobbled dangerously beneath her, but allowed her a better vantage point. Fiona meanwhile, approached the opening in the broken wall cautiously. Most of the cars of the barricade had fallen out into the river, now lying like a row of tomb stones. There was one car though, that laid on it's side, but was suspiciously clean. Patience's bottle laid in pieces around it, a one in a million shot.

It was an electric luxury sedan, bright red and unrusted. It had bright dark holes in it's side where it seemed to have been sprayed with gunfire, and safety glass had been scattered down in a direct line painting a neat path from the highway, to the wall, to the car itself. Fiona pulled out a pair of binoculars to examine it.

"It's a Nikola, blood trailing from it like someone got carried off." She called out, "I think that's the private eye Shoresy talked about."

"How do you know?" Patience asked, climbing down the car to take the binoculars from Fiona. She followed Fiona's finger, as she started pointing in the distance.

"Look at the plate."

Patience squinted through the binoculars, and sure enough the plate said "SHORESY." She mused aloud, finding it easier if she spoke her thoughts. "Electric cars are pretty rare, I don't even think he blinked twice about letting us use the Einstein either."

"Well, maybe he just really loves his daughter," Fiona leaned back against the truck that Shoresy had lent them. "Family can straighten out a man's priorities right quick."

Patiences laughed, "You're talking about Shoresy right? Not some other walking ham-hock we've met recently? I once saw Shoresy bust a man's kneecaps over fifty dollars."

"Fifty dollars is a lot these days."

"Right..." She tossed the binoculars back to Fiona. Then Patience said, "I want to know why it got hit by Night Creatures, <i>and</i> bulletfire. Seems excessive, even for one of Dracula's freaks. We should come back here in the day, not during vampire hours."

Down in the river, they'd have nowhere to hide. Vampires and Night Creatures were too fast without the numerous buildings, streets, and alleyways to duck and weave through. Though at least the car was near Boyle Heights, where it'd be safer to poke around.

They came up on the interchange where the checkpoint had been built. A tall confusing network of concrete spaghetti and criss crossing make shift bridges. Large parts of it were just filled with vehicles that had been pushed off the sides of higher freeways, onto the lower ones, creating chokepoints and narrow passageways. Boyle Heights had been well armed when America fell, and after a few years of intense warfare, both inside, and from a surrounding siege, a pecking order and makeshift government had formed.

The nearly forty different gangs that existed in the densely packed blocks had eventually found using ammo on each other wasteful. Territorial boundaries had been drawn, and mostly respected. The intense fighting had many of the old heads with long standing grudges die off. Then young soldiers no longer needing to prove themselves took over. With that came sharing of equipment and expertise.

As disgusting as the LA river is, it was still water. Solar-powered water purifying technology had become more compact, and sludge had been converted into potable fluids. They were able to expand greatly, and huge vertical hydroponic farms fed dozens of thousands of survivors. Even grow in over-abundance, to trade and create an economic dominant center in the city.

Fiona and Patience passed beneath giant guns that trailed their path, but were allowed through without questioning. They both sighed with relieve as they entered under bright lights, tall walls, and armed soldiers that monitored the borders of their community.

<hr></hr>

Bright streaks of multicolored spotlights illuminated a haze of bugs and smog in the sky. They flashed and painted random patterns on the clouds. As Patience and Fiona approached the distant apartment building, they felt the music before they heard it. Deep reverberating bass that kicked the chest with every drumbeat, and slow instrumentals underlaid beneath rapid lyrics that they couldn't make out. Monica's apartment building was a square fortress with a large parking lot that had a raised station placed in the center. Even two blocks away, Patience wondered if anyone inside could hear each other.

Fiona pulled out her pistol and checked that a round was chambered, before sliding it into her neoprene holster. They were still far enough out of sight to do their checks. She also touched her ankle to make sure a bundle of needles were strapped to her leg in a tall laboratory vial filled with a mysterious purple liquid. "Having a party are they?"

Patience raised her eyebrow looking at Fiona, "Are you expecting company? We're here to just snoop around, bang on doors."

"Doesn't hurt to be careful does it?" She pulled out a long thin cigar with a wooden mouth piece and lit it, filling the air with sweet tobacco and champagne flavored smoke.

Patience ignored her, "It might be a public party, three guys with guns by the door." She was right, they could see as they reached the end of the block that the archway that led further inside had been flanked with guards. Someone had gotten ahold of police tape, and wrapped it around traffic cones to create a coiling line of guests. Patience had learned the secret to being anywhere you weren't supposed to be was to move with purpose, keep your eyes forward and don't mean mug

As they stepped into line, Fiona pressed in close, their body heat mingling in the chill of the night. With a daring move, Fiona slipped her hand into the waistband of Patience's pants, sending a tantalizing shiver up her spine. Her hand was cold, but not unpleasantly so, and her fingers were gentle yet insistent as they explored, tracing a path from Patience's waist to the top of her thigh.

Patience couldn't help but make a choked noise and tried to recover with a dry swallow. Even after a few years, she couldn't help but feel warm tingles radiate across herself anytime her partner touched her. She wondered, not for the first time, if Fiona felt the same.

She gently wrapped her arm over Fiona's shoulders as they walked through the line, and then without looking at the guards started up conversation giggling, eyes locked together as they attempted to walk past. Patience gently ran her hand up and down Fiona's arm as if warming her from the cold. A guard got in their way, and they almost bumped into him. Stopping mere moments from bowling him over entirely.

"Oh my god darling, keep your eyes forward." Fiona said with a giggle.

Patience shot the guard a guilty look, and scratched the back of her head. The guard had to crane his neck to look Patience in the eye.

She took note of his weapon, an assault rifle gun of some kind with a banana clip that nearly touched the barrel making a half C shape. He was wearing blues and blacks, and had a two tattoo'd on the top of his hand, with a few daggers in the corner of his eye. His watch was expensive, and his chain (unlike the one Patience was wearing,) was real.

<i>Killer, soldier, high-ranking.</i> Patience thought to herself after her quick assesment, she looked a little past him deeper inside and noticed even more guards.

He spoke in rapid spanish, "<i>The fuck you doing here Belmont? Loser like you isn't allowed in a place like this. Fouling up the place with your bad energy.</i>"

Sometimes the easiest way to get someone to accept a bribe, is not with a sly wink and a twenty pressed into the palm of your hand. 

"Oh, sorry I forgot about the door fee." Patience said, she moved her hand into her back pocket. She made a show of trying to get into her pocket, giving the guard a dismayed look. She gently chided Fiona "Hey, relax a bit!"

Fiona giggled and pulled her hand free.

"The last guy said it was thirty for the cover charge, and then twenty for bottle service right?" She retrieved a crisp canadian fifty dollar bill. 

<i>Sometimes,</i> the easiest way is to make them think they're part of a scam. That someone has set you up as the rube, and that they can participate. They are then part of the injoke, and you are the one taken advantage of. Camraderie, as strong as it is as a tool, can lead to assumptions that are just as much as a weakness to be exploited.

<my-spoiler name="Does he accept the bribe?"><img src="/belmont/04/Heart_01_check.png"></img>
<img src="/belmont/04/Heart_01_after.png"></img></my-spoiler>

Then he spoke in english, "Right, yeah, give me that." He took the money giving her a jerk of his head dismissing her.

The two held hands, and Fiona led Patience inside. "Come on, I love this song! Let's dance." Almost at a jog they ran inside. They heard the guards laughing behind them. 

"You know, it's actually a little hard to bullshit when you're a stone's throw from my curlies." Patience whispered in Fiona's ear wrapping her hand around Fiona's waist.

In response she gave Patience a peck and then a small bite on Patience's lip. It broke a small bit of chapped skin. 

"Ow!" Patience yelped, and brought her hand up to her mouth. She couldn't help but grin despite the sting.

"You'll be fine, I've seen you perform when I was much closer than that." Fiona pressed her hands against Patience's abs, staring at up at her face.

The tips of Patience's ears had turned a bright red. She didn't return the stare, she was surveying the open-air club. Past the guarded choke point, the parking lot had many covered spaces, the dividers inside had been knocked down, leaving only pointed roofs. While the faded spaces on the outside of the large square had been covered by the already existing apartments.

In one corner, the transformation was particularly striking. An outdoor bar had been set up, utilizing the apartment's back porch as its main serving area. The adjoining apartment itself served a practical purpose, acting as the kitchen and storeroom, bustling with activity to support the bar. Windows of the living spaces above revealed a tapestry of life – adorned with an eclectic mix of vinyl stickers, whiteboard drawings, and flags, each window telling its own story of the inhabitants within.

Fiona gave Patience a light squeeze to get her attention. "Oi, look over there." Patience looked over her shoulder, when she saw a large piece of butcher paper painted with thick paint in cursive.

<u>Congratulations Monica Fernandez! The newest member of the family!</u>

"She took her mom's name?" Patience asked, "Or do you think it's someone else."

"Has to be her, doesn't it?"

Patience nodded. She looked around the club again, trying to discern where to best spend their efforts. Something about the whole thing was off. Was Monica being inducted into her mother's crime family today a coincidence? Did she have something do with the PI's death, and the attack on Shoresy's club? What about her Mother?

[ ] - Investigate the Bartenders on the Sly (Heart, Heart, Brawn or Sharp depending on successes)

[ ] - Search for Monica see if you can investigate her directly, (Sharp, Heart, Heart)

[ ] - Actively tell people what happened at Shoresy's, see if you can get Monica's attention (Brawn, Heart or Heart, Sharp)

[ ] - Let Fiona take the lead (Magic, Sharp, Sharp, Magic, Magic)

- In the name of more clarity and choice, I will now be adding in which checks will show up in the entirety of a specific update.
