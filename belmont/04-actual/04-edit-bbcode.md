With a jerk of her head, Patience signaled to Fiona, "C'mon then, let's get some drinks." She gave her partner a wink and they pushed forward through the gyrating masses. The thick music gave way to loud, excited chatter. Everything was a bit slower around the bar, as people stopped and talked, flitting to and fro with drinks to their various groups and parties. They had lucked out, approaching just as there was a lull in the excitement.

Patience sat at the bar and held up a five-dollar bill. It only took a few seconds for a bartender to quickly make his way to her and Fiona to collect it. He was old, sun-weary, and raw. His skin had a tawny hue with a dark amber undertone. His salt-and-pepper hair was styled into a high and tight updo. All of the bartenders were wearing blue long sleeves under black vests.

As he pocketed the bill, he said, "Hey, I'm keeping this but just so you know, it's an open bar. What can I get you?" He also had tears tattooed around his eyes, which had become so grizzled that Patience could barely see them beneath his bristly brows. "Ah shit, Belmont, who let you in here?"

"How the fuck does everyone know me?" Patience said with a laugh. "I'm not that famous, am I?"

The bartender replied, "You fuck around with Shoresy, que no? Down at Sapphire."

She tried to play it off, "Uh, no? He's a little short for me," and looked to Fiona with a worried expression. "Do people not think I'm gay? Is it the way I dress?"

"Hon, have you looked in a mirror lately?" Fiona snorted, plucking at her denim jacket. "It's definitely not that, for sure."

"No, not like tha—" The bartender rolled his eyes. "Nevermind, you getting a drink or what?"

"Hmm? Oh Yeah! Two strawberry brandies, please." The hydroponic systems of Boyle Heights grew some of the sweetest strawberries around, making them one of the best crops for a water-based setup. These were then picked and brewed into an infamous brandy that could only be found here. A rare, expensive delicacy.

Fiona nudged her in the ribs, and Patience added, "Oh, neat, please." Even though the water was purified, Fiona still had qualms about drinking ice made from the river.

The bartender snorted, "Yeah, sure."

And so began the playful tug and pull for the bartender's attention. Patience sat and chatted with Fiona, smiling. When he seemed to stray too far, Patience would tip again. She was starting to get nervous; Shoresy's money spent freely but was not unlimited. Still, it was the easiest way to get the attention she needed. After the third brandy, she stopped him, "Hey, what's your name, friend?" she asked with her best attempt at a winning smile.

"Carlos," he responded.

[i]Look at that, already warming up,[/i] she thought. His tone had shifted; much of the brusqueness from before was gone. While he was still short-tempered, he seemed more eager not to offend. There was another benefit: as Carlos began to hover closer to Patience to pay attention to her tips, the crowd itself moved around them to better get his attention. Slowly, quietly, she had shifted the eyou of the storm, until she and Fiona could quietly surveil the entirety of the crowd with little to no interference.

Except, there was a [i]slight[/i] issue. In order to [i]keep[/i] Carlos' attention, she needed refills, and to get refills, her glass needed to be empty. Unfortunately, as Carlos had been warming up to her—or at least her money—the drinks in turn started to grow in size and strength.

After the ninth or twelventeenth glass, Carlos came over to check on them. "Ey, you good, Belmont?"

"Yeah, of course!" She gave Carlos a wink as she finished her drink and handed him another bill. "Haven't you heard my calling card? I'm six-three and pure muscle. She's the one you gotta watch," she said, leaning in close. "She's a devil for the drink." Then she winced internally; she knew she was mirroring Fiona's accent. [i]How strong is this brandy, Christ?[/i]

Fiona slapped Patience hard on the head, the sound making a loud crack. "How dare you! I'm fond of a pint or two, is all. Christ on a cross, Patience. you can't be saying that about a woman."

The sting cleared her senses a bit, and helped her shake off the creeping anxiety. They both started to laugh.

Carlos rolled his eyes. "Alright, next one's water for you two."

"Water!? You know fish piss in that?" Fiona youlled a bit too loudly, falling into Patience's arms with a giggle. "Gosh, you're strong, Patience." It took her a second to realize that Patience was holding the entirety of her weight.

Patience's head fell forward as her brain seemed to slosh in its wet casing. She steadied it against Fiona's forehead, her nose filling with the smell of coconut and roses. [i]How the hell does she still find so much perfume?[/i] Her mind flitted between thoughts weakly, without any real connection between them.

"Hey," Patience said, "does it bother you when that happens?"

Fiona laughed. "When what happens, love?"

"When I end up copying your accent. I don't mean to."

"Oh no, no, of course not. You can't help it, can you? It's just how you are. I'd have been long gone if shite like that got to me," she snorted. "You're always worrying. Just enjoy things!"

[i]God, she's perfect, everything's perfect.[/i] Patience hadn't noticed when Carlos had approached, but she heard the glasses clink against the bar. "Hey, can you switch us to water for like... the rest of the night?"

Carlos shot her a smile and laughed, "Yeah. No problem. I won the bet a while ago, anyway."

With one arm wrapped around Fiona, who had climbed into her lap at some point, Patience handed her the glass of water. Then she took one for herself and started to chug it. The clean, cool liquid lubricated her dry throat, and she felt its coldness seep down from her mouth to her core, spreading and smothering the flames that had ignited inside.

Fiona looked up at her from her arms. "What? Have I got something on my face?"

"No..." Patience shook her head. "Just thinking about, uh..."

Her vision started to fade for a moment.

Patience shook off the liquor's effects. "Whoa," she muttered, not quite sure what was happening but managing to pull herself together.

She lifted her spinning head to see Carlos collecting cash from the other bartender. Straining her ears, she caught them saying, "You were right, they drank four bottles. I've never seen that before."

"That's the difference between me and you. Experience," Carlos said with a nod, passing on his sage wisdom. "You see how much I made tonight? The entire job is just making sure the right ones get drunk, and the wrong ones never get close."

Fiona tapped her chest and pointed. Patience glanced at where she was pointing and noticed that an ice chest had been dropped off. It wasn't much larger than a lunch pail, but small clouds of fog seeped out of the closed lid. She looked back to Fiona with a quizzical expression. Fiona rolled her eyes, then pointed at her canines, jerking her fingers downward.

"What?" Patience whispered.

Before Fiona could answer, Carlos picked up the ice chest. "Go give this to one-oh-seven."

The other bartender groaned, "Bro, they give me the creeps."

"Yeah, well, you wanted double or nothing. That's the other thing about experience – not taking stupid bets. Now go. Ándale, the sooner you go, the sooner you come back," Carlos said sternly, jamming the plastic box into the other bartender's chest.

The other bartender grabbed it with an angry click of his teeth and swore under his breath, [i]"Fuck..."[/i] before marching off.

As the water washed away some of the rougher edges of her drunken stupor, Patience began to feel more collected.

"Hey, Belmont," Carlos called as she got up.

Patience whirled around. "Yeah?"

"You're gonna want to get out of here before they cut the cake, yeah?" Carlos said. "They'll cut you open like a fish if you're caught walking around here at the wrong time."

"Right... Okay," Patience replied.

"I'm serious." The bartender's voice held steel, and the importance of his words started to sink in. "Everyone who isn't family needs to be gone. We let people sneak in, but make sure you walk out before it's too late."

Patience nodded firmly. "Thanks." She didn't fully understand what 'too late' meant, but she knew they needed to leave soon. Still, she wanted to check out Room 107 before departing.

Together, Fiona and Patience deduced the numbering of the apartments and began walking through them. As they moved further from the party, an unsettling chill seeped into their bones—an eerie cold that didn't just freeze them physically but seemed to drain the fires of their souls.

"How much cash we got left?" Fiona asked. Patience had been rifling through her wallet mostly to keep her hands busy as they walked.

"Hmm? Oh, uh... Shit," she said quietly. Between the drinks and the bribe, they had already spent nearly half their money. "Not as much as I'd like."

Fiona nodded quietly. The music, which only two blocks away felt so loud and thick it was like being kicked in the chest, now sounded muffled and almost dead. Patience squeezed Fiona as the smaller woman shivered in silence. She realized that whatever this silencing aura was, it had affected the area around the bar, making it a deliberate choice for quieter conversation, away from the music. This, along with the ice chest, made it clear that Dos eMe was well aware of whatever supernatural entities were at play.

There was a slight squelching that clung to her boots as she walked. Looking down, she noticed something off-brown and sticky on the ground. Not only that, a familiar unsettling odor in the air set her hackles on end. [i]Blood,[/i] she thought. [i]Shit.[/i]

"Vampires?" Fiona asked, looking down at the blood.

Patience shook her head. "I don't think so... They're still people, just, you know... Dead. They wouldn't just leave blood out on the patio like this." She reached down and touched the brown liquid; it was still wet but beginning to oxidize. "Think about Cruz."

"The Zodiac Killer, you mean? Or Dracula?"

"Both." Something about the place made Patience want to run, to just turn around and sprint far, far away.

She heard the crunching crack of bone, and the wet licks and chomps. The wet exhales of ravenous breath and guttural slurping came from around the corner, unnerving in their inhumanity. The noise sounded... [i]wrong,[/i] painfully so. Every part of her screamed to escape as she reached around the corner. Taking a deep breath, she willed herself to look.

The beast was a humanoid figure with two long bat-like wings shrouding it. Patience could see long, greasy blonde curls cascading down a gaunt, hollow face dripping with blood. Its jaw was too big for its mouth, and she could see the teeth and gums distended from its lips as it reached down to rip another morsel free. The snapping sound she heard was the creature's jaw popping and crunching as it stripped meat from bone, with flecks of blood spraying from the body. Patience recognized the cooler from downstairs and realized this must have been the young bartender who had been sent.

The creature started to sniff the air, letting out a breathy hiss, and spoke into the air in front of it, creating a puff of steamy condensation, "[i]Belmoonnnt...[/i]"

"Nope," Patience whispered under her breath, signaling to Fiona to quietly leave. But just as they were about to run, she caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of her eye.

It was Monica Laroux, a young woman who was pale but vibrant, bearing a striking resemblance to her father. She had the same soft jaw, squashed nose, and rosy pink complexion, though she was far less mottled and haggard than Shoresy. When she moved, she stumbled, as if being tugged by a rope around the chest, launching herself forward with jerky, pigeon-toed steps. Monica had a side shave, and her remaining locks transitioned from brown to a blood-red ombre at the tips.

The creature whipped its head around at Monica, before looking back down the hallway where it had smelled Patience. Annoyed and struck with indecision, it tried to determine its next move.

Monica walked with heavy, slow, stomping steps.

[i]Thump... Thump... Thump...[/i]

She inched her way toward the beast, which stood up and placed its hands on its own teeth to force its gaping maw back into place. As its wings retracted, Patience noticed the creature was wearing a cocktail vest that tied behind, covering the middle of its back. With its wings hidden, its hips seemed to shimmy back and forth like a pendulum, as if trying to lure Patience into a hypnotic trance.

The creature's jaws snapped ravenously as it stepped away from the corpse, a sight that made Fiona feel nauseous. The man's entrails were spilled across the floor, with wet strands of gristle threading from his broken ribcage inward. His stomach had been devoured to the spine, and his face was half-removed. Gases seemed to still be moving through the body, causing parts to bulge and sink in a random rhythm, with long white trails of steam pouring off into the night air.

The creature extended a hand with dainty, delicate fingers, now stained with blood. It reached out to Monica, beckoning her forward. Her eyes widened with horror, and she tried to pull back, but the creature let out an inhuman squeal that made her go slack. Her feet moved of their own accord, slapping down the blood-soaked hallway.

[i]Thump. Thump. Thump.[/i]

"Patience, go!" Fiona urged from behind, giving Patience a gentle shove.

Patience growled but stepped forward nonetheless, reaching back for her guitar. As she pulled it free, the wicked strings and toothy imp melded into its normal pristine blade. With a heavy stomp, she yelled, "Oi! Dickhead!"

The creature turned around, revealing the blood-streaked face of a fallen angel, one of the vampires' many demonic forces. It roared in anger upon seeing Belmont, but it was too late – the axe was already flying through the air.

The blade struck true, the fallen angel managing to get its hand up just in time. It sunk deep into the creature's arm, eliciting an inhuman shriek of rage. Patience groaned, feeling liquid drip out of one ear as it began to bleed. Her eyes felt gritty and uncomfortably dry, while her tongue seemed to swell inside her mouth. There was an audible [i]pop[/i], and the creature shifted.

It... no, the angel was a person... her... Her clothes seemed to evaporate into mist, and she let out the most beautiful noise. Patience knew what she had to do; she had to embrace the angel. She saw in the angel's eyes her own reflection—a perfect her. She yearned to be clay in the angel's hands, to be sculpted into something unique and beautiful, something that shined with such brilliance it could only burn away the feeble trappings of her flesh. She wanted its tongue to carve away her skin, and with it, the concept of inhibition.

She stepped towards her true self, towards unachievable perfection. The angel's hand reached up to caress her, and a tongue too long for either of their mouths lolled out. Cla—

[b][i]BLAM BLAM BLAM[/b][/i]

Claws, horrific blood-soaked talons, shot forward to scrape at the spot where Patience had just been, leaving a trail of wet blood in their wake. The creature hissed angrily as a new hole in its shoulder spilled disgusting black ichor onto the painted cement. Patience snatched her axe out of the creature's arm, swearing angrily. She swung at it hard.

Behind her, she heard Fiona screaming, "Get away from her, you daft cunt!" before she squeezed off a few more rounds for good measure.

Beneath them, they heard the Dos eMe soldiers start to shout in anger, and the music was quickly cut off.

Monica stood there slack-jawed, her eyes having a milky sheen as swirling clouds seemed to pool over her pupils and irises.

Patience weighed her options quickly:

[] "Fiona, you take the creature, I'll get the girl!" Relying on Fiona's magic seemed the best course of action. <Magic - Magic - Sharp>
[] "Fiona, on me!" She needed Fiona's support for a direct confrontation. <[COLOR="RED"]Brawn[/COLOR] - Magic - Sharp>
[] "Hey, Monica, you need to snap out of it. Come here! NOW!" Perhaps she could convince Monica to snap out of her trance and fight the beast hand-to-hand. <Heart - [COLOR="RED"]Brawn[/COLOR] - Magic>
[] "Fiona, give me your gun!" Switching to Fiona's gun might give her the edge she needed. <Sharp - Sharp - Sharp>
[] "Think... Think..." Maybe there was a better plan she hadn't considered yet. <Sharp - [COLOR="RED"]Brawn[/COLOR] - Brawn>
