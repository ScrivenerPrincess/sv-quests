[X] - "I care, but it's not something I'll fight over," Nala admitted, "I want to understand what's normal here, not punish someone who was mind-controlled by a monster." <Nala does blame Donnegan for what happened, but chooses to work with him.></Nala>

River regarded Nala with an unmistakable expression of respect. They acknowledged her decision with a nod before addressing Chloe, "She has made up her mind." They became gentle, and pulled out their book, "Here let me repair your uniform. Your sleeves are all burnt to shit."

They ran their fingers over a passage, and the jacket sewed itself back together. The drained from River's, and they paled from their normal vivid red, to a light pink.

Chloe seemed to want to argue, and also seemed bothered, but she didn't say anything else.

"Right now, it's not worth the hassle," Nala said. "I'm not happy about what transpired, but I won't stir trouble on my first day here." She felt a soft touch on her hind legs and turned to see Crystal indicating a desire to be picked up.

Nala hoisted the fox onto her shoulders, and the creature perched there, like a clumsy parrot. She had become surprisingly small and settled snugly into the curve of Nala's neck. Crystal yawned and then suggested, "Can we steer this conversation towards some chickens? Or mice? I'm extremely hungry."

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally: Honestly we could eat too.</i></span>

"Hmm. Sure." River led the group through the city, to a small wooden cart that was filled with half moon pastries. They smelled of baked dough, and seafood. They ordered three, and passed out the food quickly.

It was called a patty, and it tasted delectable. The pastry was filled with heavily spiced meats that were hot, and heavy. Nala was warmed to the bones, and the heat made her tongue decadently numb. She realized that the constant walking and exertion had made her appetite ravenous, and after she had devoured her first, she eyed the stand with greed.

River, quickly gave Chloe a nudge, and passed her a small bag of coin, who handed it to Nala. They said, "This is yours your starting stipend. Would have gotten it during orientation."

The coins in the bag were silver. On one side, it had been emblazoned with crossed swords, and the other was a dove. They were heavy and ornate, some sort of magic press had made each coin nearly identical. Nala was quick to trade a few coins for a pair of pattiess, that she had finished just as Chloe and River had finished their first.

[X] - Later she said, "Can we start today then?"

"So, if Donnegan is leading work studies, does that mean we're protectors now?" Nala asked, once everyone —including Crystal— had finished eating.

"Yeah" River replied, "Here, do you have a spell book? You'll need one." They openned theirs, and tilted it towards Nala

Nala was confused, "Could I not just cast it somatically?" Though once she saw it, she quickly knew that she could not.

To do so would take nearly half an hour, and require learning dozens of hand gestures. Not only that it looked like part of the spell book referenced other parts that had been stored and re-used previously. Just to read the complicated glamor, it took Nala a couple of minutes.

She had in that moment, became very appreciative of the time spent learning spelltheory with Chloe and Tamil earlier. The simple building blocks were allowing her to piece together the spell very quickly, and even more, figure out how to expand upon it if she wished.

<i>Spellcrafting I</i> &&
<span class="cruel"><i>[X] Scribbled Spellbook [Cr]</i></span>

Nala quickly fished out the small pocketbook from the day before, and then flipped through the scribbled pages. She was able to locate a very similar spell to the glamor. It was uncompleted.

Curiously, River looked over his book at the notebook, and then pointed. "The spell on the back is for editing text."

Nala ran her fingers over the back of the notebook and focussed. Tiny purple sparks of light traced over the ink, and the messy scribbly scrawl seemed to straighten itself with impossibly neat and ornate handwriting. A tight cursive, without accent or flourishes. Many of the struck out passages were moved, and the book itself seemed to rearrange as Nala focussed on it.

While reading River's book, she managed to finish the spell itself, and then added the other spells she had learned that day. It had taken but a moment, though she started to become peckish once again.

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i> With a quick toss of her palm, she finished the glamor. Thinking of her coronation, the make-up, and a painting of herself the witch had commissioned before she had died.</span>

"You might want to transfer that to something more hefty. Like a warded book later." River said, but there was a warble in their voice. Nala wasn't sure what she had done to cause that reaction. Then she realized that they weren't looking at her book, they were looking at <i>her.</i>

- [X] - <b>Spell Acquired - Minor Glamor</b>
- [X] - <b>Sustaining Spell - Minor Glamor</b>

<i>Did you all do something,</i> Nala had a rictus grin on her face, with her eyebrows wrinkling the center of her forehead.

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i></span> A harsh grumble crawled through Nala's mind, <span class="witch"><i>do not think too much of it, girl.</i></span>

Nala turned to Chloe, who gave her a warm smile. While Crystal giggled to herself quietly, in that same fox bark laughter.

Protector work, Nala had soon found out, was rather boring. The following hours were spent meandering around the city and chatting. Chatting not only with each other, but chatting with store clerks, money tenders, children, and people doing their daily tasks. Nala had introduced herself more times then the she could count, and had met more than twice as many people. She had learned routes through the city, and had slowly gotten familiar with the way it had been labeled and laid out.

One of the people she met was Mr. Grayson. An elderly man who owned a farm just outside the gates. His hair was long, wavy, and bright pink like bubblegum. He spoke with a rural accent, and his hands were dry and cracked from working the earth. Nala had been quite shocked to learn that he also <i>lived</i> outside the gates, where the Drakkenai seemed to roam. The three had helped him load his cart of his remaining crops for the day to the Academy by the wharf. It was apparently a daily habit of Mr. Grayson's to give that which he hadn't sold — but would soon rot — to the student's cafeteria to eat.

"Ah well Ms. Nala, don't you worry about us none. Someone's gotta keep this town fed hehah." He carried a large tube, called a shotgun, that was apparently an extremely dangerous weapon. "Us Graysons, why we've been taking care-a Sabryna longer then Sabryna's been Sabryna. Hell us Grayons were here before the first empire. Dating back to the first'uns." 

Mr. Grayson had plenty of stories, some of which Chloe and River had even confirmed as true.

It was a Grayson that had mapped every island, creating one of the first complete maps of the world. Though the map had long been lost since then.

It was also a Grayson that had developed some of the first defenses that the town used, acting as a backbone for the defensive shields used during the New Moon.

When the first empire came, to try and take their people, it was a Grayson that had united the islands and defeated them.

And when the second empire surrendered, it was a Grayson who wrote up the peace treaty.

"Hell girl, it was the thirty second Admiral, Karaboa Grayson that first circumnavigated the globe! That's a history story for later though I reckon. Thank you kindly for helping with the bags. Here take a soursop." They had just finished loading everything into the kitchen, and Mr. Grayson gave them a warm goodbye. Before he left he handed them a prickly green fruit, the insides were delicate, like a banana, and it tasted like intensely sweet-sour citrus.

Nala had learned that Sabryna was the name of both the island they were on, and the nation. It had never been colonized — though not from lack of effort of their neighbors — and that Terra was an archipelagic world. Queenston and a handful of other surrounding islands that were part of the nation Sabryna, were called links. There were also dozens of sovereign states on Terra. Though as the third empire spread, that number was quickly dwindling. People came to Sabryna because they were an open nation to all, and because they were always open they had always been just ahead of the curve scientifically. Those fleeing brutality would bring their knowledge with them, and few who came to spy wished to leave.

"Some people call Sabryna the Siren nation," Chloe had explained with a small laugh, "People come here lured by the calls of freedom, never to return."

River spat into the street, "Funny what happens when you treat people right."

<hr></hr>

After a delicious dinner in the cafeteria, the day had soon come to a close.

[X] - Sabryna and World History: The Basics

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally: </i>Nala remembered, as the trio were winding down for the day, that she normally would read before sleeping. She took a moment, before Chloe and River said goodbye, to ask one of them for a book.

[ ] Ask River to lend Nala a book - +1 Bonding with River.
[ ] Ask Chloe to lend Nala a book - +1 Bonding with Chloe.
[ ] Study the pocket-book - Add spell.
</span>

While she hadn't commented on it, Nala took note that the room across from her had been emptied, and that Chloe and River's rooms had been moved to either side of her own. Though she knew it was not for her safety, there was something comforting about it after so much time alone.

It was also though a reminder that she was on a probation of sorts, and that she was also being closely watched. When they were out, walking and talking, it felt easy to forget. The painful reality of her situation though, flanked by guards, reminded her that she needed to be careful, and that Chloe and River may not have her best interests in heart.

When she rested on the bed though, with a book, she still felt something. The anxious thumping in her chest had subsided, and been replaced with a soft calmness.

[X] Spy on Chloe and Tamil's conversation.

Crystal had been pressing her ear to the door for the last hour, and seemed satisfied with something. The fox quickly rushed over, and with an excited — but silent — yip. It then started to regale Nala with what had happened between Chloe and Tamil.

"So Chloe and Tamil today... Do you really want to know?" Crystal had said. Her rump was in the air behind her wriggling, and her pupils had nearly swallowed her irises in excitement.

Nala rolled her eyes, "Yes, I want to know."

"Are you sure?!" Crystal goaded, "Once you know there's no going back."

<span class="cruel"><i>The Cruel:</i></span> Nala grabbed a pillow from behind her and swung at the creature. With a small smile she commanded the fox to speak, <span class="cruel">"Tell me fox."</span>

"Alright alright." Crystal laughed, leaping forward over the pillow. She landed on Nala's shoulders, and rested her paws on Nala's head. Crystal's size seemed to adapt for the greatest amount of levity in the moment. "Chloe had been watching you with a bit more than caution on your recent walks."

"Oh I'm so sure." Nala rolled her eyes, but her cheeks had become warm.

She wasn't entirely sure what she had expected the fox to say. She knew it <i>must</i> have been something along those lines, the signs seemed obvious. Nala had become a flush at the idea of being wanted in a few short moments of arriving to this new world, at being desired, especially after years of being feared. Of course it would happen, but she allowed herself a moment of pride at it happening so fast.

"Now, remember not to think about that at all." Crystal said with mischief glinting in her eyes.

"Why shouldn't I think about it?" Nala replied confused.

Crystal broke out in more manic giggles, "Because of the mind reader? One mix River?"

Nala wanted to scream, "Oh my god, they know that:

[ ] - Every free moment today I've been gawking at my own glamor. <i>Nala will reveal more of her vanity.</i>
[ ] - I've just been obsessing over them. Like... Dangerously so.  <i>Nala will reveal more of her obsessiveness.</i>

She fell back, and let out a wail of despair. "Why did you tell me that?!"

"Careful with asking for forbidden knowledge. Man, wonder how that makes them feel." With a snicker, Crystal over to Nala's desk, and was staring at a large bottle. "That's gotta be awkward. They're both probably worried about how those kind of feelings would mix with the dynamic between all three of you."

Nala took a deep breath, "I guess it <i>is</i> rather inappropriate given the power imbalance." She exhaled and wanted to scream, "Wait, does that mean that River also knows about Councilor's... Obsession?"

"Mmmhmmphf" Her affirmative was rather muffled, as Crystal's mouth was full with the glass handle to a bottle of brandy. She dragged it to Nala's hand.

Once the bottle reached her, Nala quickly took the cap off and started to chug. "How? How did I end up in this situation?! Why was I made so pretty?!"

<span class="ally"><i>Be careful what you wish for I suppose,</i></span> Nala rubbed her eyes remembering the little voices in her head, <span class="ally"><i>You might just get it. You said you didn't want anyone to fear you right?</i></span>

<i>How in god's name did that mean starting my own harem?!</i>

<span class="ally"><i>Oh come on, it's not that bad.</i></span>

<span class="cruel"><i>The Cruel:</i> "I rather like the strong one. She seems to have some grit."</span> With a wave of his hand, he gestured at the fox. <span class="cruel">"We should probably speak aloud, for the creature's benefit."</span>

"Ok, what?" Nala took another swig, "Please explain."

<span class="cruel">"River..."</span> Thinking, The Cruel was trying to choose his words very carefully, <span class="cruel">"Seems like a project."</span>

<span class="ally">"You <i>have</i> to know how awful that sounds."</span>

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i> "I would just like to remind you all,"</span> The Witch's bouncy, accented growl cut in. <span class="witch">"You do not actually have to make choices like this. Anyone who would be pursuing you while in charge of <i>watching you,</i> would not be suitable as a partner."</span>

<span class="witch"> "This is in fact, a very bad thing. A very dangerous thing. Not a thing to be clucking like hens about."</span> Then, she took another big swig of the bottle, <span class="witch">"I know I have raised you better than this."</span>

The fox laughed, "Oh wow, you're nuts aren't you?"

Deflated, Nala let out a defeated groan and said, "No. I'm not nuts, I'm cursed. It was part of the spell that sent me here."

"Cursed with what exactly?" Crystal said, watching Nala with curiosity.

"Cursed to... Talk to myself. I guess. Memories, feelings, little chunks of me that broke off at some point. One's my mother, another is my intuition. I haven't figured out the other two, I've been distracted by..."

"Theys, gays, and flambees?" Crystal offered helpfully.

The bottle had found it's way to Nala's lips once again, "Has anyone told you you're <i>incredibly</i> vexing?"

"No, but I'm sure that conversation will be in my near future," The small creature trotted over to Nala, though sat just out of arm's reach. "Why'd you take off? I feel like being a Queen had to be better than catching fireballs with your face."

Nala went to take another swig, but the bottle was empty and she threw it haphazardly letting the glass shatter into a magic receptacle. She winced at the crashing rancorous din.

"My spouse had died, and I had never <i>wanted</i> to be a ruler. When that stupid overgrown lizard chose to kick the bucket, everyone had assumed I had 'lost my edge.' I realized that if I stuck around I'd end up fighting another dozen wars, but this time alone, for people I hated." She snorted, "I was planning to be a swamp witch like my mother, but I had found a spell that promised something more."

"What do you mean chose to die? You mean like..." The fox made a squish noise, and then dragged her paw across her own throat.

"No, well not like that. We were sharing my time to keep him alive. I lied about it, and when he found it, he wanted to cut it off." She was blunt, trying to cut through the story as painlessly as possible, "In the end, I realized if I kept being stubborn, then I just wouldn't get to say goodbye, but after he was gone. I realized that a goddess is pretty unapproachable."

Crystal snorted, "Wait did you really leave because you thought you had become a god?"

"Yes, absolutely," Nala nodded, "Look at what I can do, the way I carry myself. I am beautiful, charismatic, powerful, I was capable of breaking not only cities, or nations, but an entire world. What else would I be perceived as. Once most people know me they can't help but worship."

The fox snorted, "So do lots of gods in your world ask mommy to be less gentle?"

Nala swung at Crystal without warning, completely missing the fox as it leaped clear. Instead she collided with the wall, leaving a softball size hole in it. They both fled from her small bed with panic. Black veins of ichor dripped from the wall to her nails. It oozed like an infected wound. Both stared the wall in horror. 

"Oh <i>no.</i>" Nala said without breath.

The veins crawled inside the wall, eating away at it. Tiny bubbles of white plaster mixed with oily ichor started to pop and boil, foaming heavily. Both watched in silent horror as the hole got bigger, and bigger. River, in the adjacent room whirled around in shock.

They shouted, "What did you <i>do!?</i>"

Nala froze in panic, eyes locked on River. The back of her mind registered, that this was more than just surprise that was affecting River's temperament. A lithany of scars and healed wounds decorated the person's body, holes, old stitches, claw marks, and slashes. Some covered by River's tight bandages they had wrapped around their chest, or clearly moving further into their breeches.

Before the wall had exploded, River had been changing the dressings on a wound. A ragged bloody bite shined with blue blood against red skin.

The fact that Nala could <i>see</i> those scars, that wound, and the importance of decency, had taken her longer than was appropriate to process.

"Sorry!" Nala locked eyes with the floor. 

"Fix the goddamn wall!" River continued to yell. "The fuck's wrong with you!"

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i> The foolish girl stopped panicking, remembering she is powerful sorceress, a witch of the wilds, and not a wimpering babe. With complicated gestures, and a few muttered words she started to banish the spell with ease. Then she gave herself time to think about her actions.</span>

The veins quickly receded after a few moments, and the wall started to reform itself.

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally:</i></span> She heard River's door slam, and before the incredibly angry person could say or do whatever they had intended, Nala called out "There was a spider on the wall! I panicked, didn't realize that spell was so strong! I'm still gathering my memories!"

The silence stretched out beneath her, and Nala's heart stopped. She winced as she waited to see if she would get a reply. Instead, she just heard River's door slam again.

Crystal turned to the young necromancer, "Nala?"

"Yes?"

"I don't want to make the same mistake twice. Did you just try to obliterate me for making fun of you and Chloe? Or for implying you might not be equivalent to divinity."

"The uh... The latter. Reflex. Sorry." Nala cleared her throat, "I hadn't really thought about how I might react to that outside of my home."

"You may want to work on finding a healthier way to handle being teased." Crystal suggested, with a gulp. "So you were an evil queen then?"

"Yes well... Ahem. I'm sure some would say I was evil, but that's rumored about every head of state." She tried to smooth her naval uniform, "I wore a lot of black, raised the dead, people made assumptions."

Taking a deep breath, Nala moved herself to the bathroom to sip water from the sink, "I actually don't mind mocking at all, outside of a few touchy subjects."

"Like... What?"

"Mmmmm... Don't make fun of my late partner, and the ah, the god jokes. I take that rather seriously. My nation was a theocracy. It's kind of a defense mechanism." The necromancer was now running her stinging hand under the faucet.

"What was the religion called?"

Nala winced, "Lenasm. The worship of the God-Queen Lena, and her dragon consort."

"Wow."

In a tone that almost seemed pleaful, Nala added, "If it helps, the only tennants were 'Don't be cruel' and 'Don't raise an army.' Noth— Nothing Weird."

Crystal nodded in slow motion, their eyes wide and vacant as they stared at where the hole in the wall was. Meanwhile, Nala had been giving Crystal a weak smile in reassurance. They sat like that in awkward silence, when Crystal jerked, snapping out of their stupor.

"Oh!" Crystal yelped quickly, "Yeah of course, counts loads. Bonus points AND kudos." Her tone dripped with sarcasm.

"Should I warn them tell the—" Nala started to say, but Crystal had already cut her off.

"No, you absolutely do not tell that to another soul." The fox had gotten serious, "You take that with you to your grave. When River catches your thoughts, we'll deal with it. People have weird intrusive thoughts all the time."

"Right." Nala gulped. "I'll... I'll watch my temper in the mean time."
