The excitement soon turned routine as Nala immersed herself in her daily tasks. She attended her work studies, absorbed various odds and ends, interacted with vibrant characters, and then returned home. Her independence swiftly returned; she managed her own bandages and focused on self-improvement. During Chloe's absences, when she watched over Donnegan, Nala found lengthy periods for solitary study. Bored, River quickly suggested they begin training. In their spare time, they had started preparing a space for their sessions.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: First Aid I: I think I understand what this does?

River mostly left Nala to herself, not addressing the events of the other night. When Nala attempted to discuss it, River appeared dismissive, always suggesting a later time would be more suitable.

Transferring her notes from the pocket spellbook to a larger, more secure version took Nala a few hours. This new book came with pages already enchanted with warding spells, protecting it from minor damage. Chloe once explained that if Nala had arrived with a later wave, one of her initial tasks would have been writing these wards, practicing her handwriting while producing spellbooks for students and citizens. Nala's handwriting was efficient, tidy, and compact, maximizing space with minimal strokes. Her proficiency only improved with practice.

She also learned to use special paper, copying master archive spells directly into her book. This bypassed the need to fully understand a spell's mechanics for casting. While Spell Craft seemed crucial, it wasn't overly mentally taxing.

However, as her late-night studies progressed, she discovered the inherent difficulties, partially mitigated by prior solutions. This allowed her to confront more complex challenges. Many spells transferred from her pocket book were "Libraries," smaller spell components that circumvented much of the spellcrafting process. Her book now functioned as a casting network, highly efficient and intricately complex.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: Spellcrafting II: Crafting with Libraries

The night before her presentation of the Wisp spell arrived, uneventful as many before. Nala had completed her work on the spellbook, content with her current knowledge. Moreover, she had penned the final line of a new spell.

"Finally, I was worried I wouldn't have it ready by tomorrow," Nala remarked to Crystal, her fox. Crystal had spent most of her time in the room napping or occasionally seeking scritches and food when Nala seemed particularly stressed.

Crystal nodded, gradually rousing from her nap. She stretched, her paws sliding across the blanket. "Hmmm?"

"You know my Rot spell? It accelerates decay using magic. I don't completely grasp how it works, and no one here has anything like it. It seems to involve a universal rune, unfamiliar to us, similar to those that increment a count or signify 'also' or 'and.' At first, I thought it might be linked to catalysts, or maybe just the concept of rotting."

Nala gestured towards a symbol in her book. "The Rot spell functions by activating this symbol, designating a target, and then increasing its effect. It seems to have some relevance, though that's not the main point. It causes decay, aging things, I believe."

"Ok?" Crystal responded, scratching her ear with her hind leg in a casual manner.

"So I combined that rune with this," Nala said, her excitement evident. In her hand, she held a small skull on the end of a needle. "It's not inducing decay. It's more about manipulating time and space. I've used it alongside this library."

"Wait, can you send things through time? Can it age living things, like a tree? This is monumental, Nala, I—"

Nala shook her head. "No, it's quite limited and consumes a significant amount of energy. Even drying herbs is more of an emergency action," she replied, her annoyance growing.

"Is this what you've been experimenting with in your spellbook? Chronomancy?" asked Crystal, astonished.

"Crystal, you're missing the point. It's not Chronomancy; it doesn't manipulate time. The rot spell is primarily necrotic. Look, I used it with this library." Nala turned to a page brimming with complex spellcraft in multicolored inks. "This section deals with constructs, making it easier to animate an object. Observe the skull. Now, will you just watch?"

Nala gently touched the skull, then snapped her fingers in succession. The skull's jaws began to clack rhythmically in response.

Crystal nodded thoughtfully, tilting her head to one side. "So, how is this useful?"

Nala paused, her lips pursed in slight annoyance as she sat at the scribe's desk in her room. "Isn't it obvious?" she said, flipping the book open on the table. "It's akin to the hourglass spell, but it doesn't rely on reading weight or sand to function. It's quite precise." She placed the needle in a small, carved half-cylinder of wood, then covered the entire piece with a glass dome. After two sharp snaps of her fingers, the device ceased its activity.

"What's this in the corner here, Nala?" Crystal asked, her voice tinged with mirth.

"What?" Nala snatched the book back towards herself and gasped softly. "Goddamnit." She hastily made hand gestures over the page to erase a drawing that occupied half of the opposite page.

It depicted Nala, grand and beautiful, alongside a figure much larger and thicker in stature. She blushed intensely; her wandering mind during spellcrafting often resulted in parts of her thoughts being transcribed into her spellbook. Much of her time was spent erasing these unintended thoughts and images. She couldn't help but wonder if handwriting would be simpler.

"That was a drawing."

"Shut it."

"And what was that drawing <i>of</i>?"

"<b>Shut it!</b>" Nala's voice carried more force.

"Girl, how old are you? Are you really doodling in the margins like some — YIP." Crystal had to dodge quickly to avoid the spellbook hurled at her. It hit the wall with a loud thud, leaving a small, smoking crater. The wall began to ripple as it healed. "Violence can't solve all your problems."

With a growl, Nala replied, "I'm only hoping it solves one problem," but soon, she found herself laughing. The fun of their game was always in the mock attempts, never in actual aggression. Crystal was far too fast to ever be hit.

Groaning, she continued, "Everyone in this world seems to be under a glamor, Crystal. They wear meticulously crafted clothes, eat well, and are ridiculously athletic." She pinched the bridge of her nose, flopping into bed. "What am I supposed to do? How does anyone stay focused? Every time one of those two does <i>anything</i>..." She shuddered.

"Oh my god, get a grip," Crystal laughed, hopping back onto the bed. "You're just experiencing proximity effects, and it's making you stir crazy."

"Crazy is definitely the word." Nala was struggling with pent-up aggression and frustration. Her constant focus on her spellbook was disrupting her sleep. The urge to tear something apart was growing; she even found herself reverting to old habits like nail-biting. If she held anything in her hands, it would be disassembled in moments of idleness. "I'm starting to regret not finding a new consort after Maldrake's death."

"You do realize you talk about your ex a lot," Crystal observed. "It's unseemly."

Nala's teeth gritted, starting to crack and pop. "He's not my EX! A death doesn't equate to a <i>divorce</i>." The ease with which the fox got under her skin was frustrating. How could she, once among the most powerful sorcerers, now be so tormented by <i>feelings</i> and <i>mockery</i>? She unclenched her jaw and took a deep breath. "But... you might be right. I do think about it too much. I need to release all this pent-up energy."

Crystal shrugged. "It sounds like you're ready to mingle with the general populace."

"I'm thinking of doing more than just mingling..." Nala glanced at the timepiece in her room, an hourglass connected to a small pile of dust forming numbers. "They must have swapped off. You should go."

"Are you sure you want me to continue spying on them?" Crystal asked as she hopped gently over to the window. "It's a massive invasion of their privacy."

"I'm just curious about what they do when I'm not around."

"Chloe gardens, River practices guitar. They don't seem to have much of a social life, to be honest. Both are always reading. I doubt I'll uncover anything new." Crystal's tone implied she was trying to reason with Nala, but Nala remained unmoved. She put the small boxed skull in a burlap sack and attached it to Crystal.

Nala shook her head. "I need to know everything. I don't like being in the dark. And, do you remember where to tell Tamil to wait?"

"Yes, we've discussed it a dozen times." Crystal rolled her eyes. "You do realize this will make you appear both insane <i>and</i> dangerous, right?"

"Just go and do it," Nala said dismissively. She was glad that she had learned that River read minds, she had dealt with their kind before, and had managed to keep her secret.

Crystal remarked, "Don't say I didn't warn you," and then departed. Meanwhile, Nala gradually drifted off to sleep.

<hr></hr>

That night, Nala experienced a peculiar dream. She was distinctly aware it was a dream, yet she had no control over it. She found herself on her chaise lounge, but the familiar void had transformed. The usual stack of books, the wine glass full of mead, even the same chaise lounge were there, but now, there were doors. These doors radiated personality, filling the room with their distinct presence.

<i>Personality?</i> Nala mused, pushing the thought aside as she surveyed her surroundings. Each door was uniquely shaped, constructed from different materials, and adorned with various accessories. Ground patches, all differing from the stone center where her lounge lay, extended from each doorway. Curiosity piqued, she stood to inspect each door in turn.

The first door was a bright pink, made of vertical wooden slats, painted with flowers and butterflies in light pastels and gentle hues. The ground in front of it sprouted cotton candy, and instead of flames, tiny fairy lights lazily circled the surrounding torches.

The second door combined wood and steel, featuring a metal-bolted bottom and a small glass window, reinforced with chicken wire. It exuded a neutral temperature, neither warm nor cold, radiating both invitation and foreboding. Cold linoleum blended into stone as it transitioned to Nala's area.

Next, she observed an iron vault door, guarded by an armored suit with a spear. As she moved, the guard's helmet seemed to follow her. Its stone floor was rough and jagged, contrasting with the smooth, paved surface of her own. She felt a pang of sympathy for whatever was confined behind it.

The final door was immediately recognizable to Nala as the entrance to a Witch's sanctuary, a realm of potent magic and possibilities. Carved into its vertical logs, within a stone brick archway, was a small heart.

Nala noticed empty slots too, many of them, in this liminal space. As she absorbed these new elements, a clicking sound, like a latch being undone, came from behind her.

Turning around, she saw another version of herself. This Nala, reminiscent of those in the bubbles from the dream with the beast, had long dreadlocks and milky white eyes. A tug at her heart revealed a deep connection; this was a part of herself she cherished, perhaps even yearned for. A growl almost escaped her as this other Nala smiled and extended her arms for a hug. Nala realized a vital fragment of her being, a defining element, had returned.

<span class="mystic"><b>(Gain voice, The Mystic)</b></span>

<span class="mystic"><i>The Mystic:</i> "And I suppose I make five,"</span> said The Mystic, her voice low and gravelly, reminiscent of a rumbling fire or crackling coals. <span class="mystic">"We're nearing completion, I suspect."</span>

"What?" Nala was taken aback, not expecting such direct communication from one of her fragments. The rest seemed as bewildered as she was, but this one... This one exuded a confidence the others lacked.

<span class="mystic">"You have many facets, like any gem,"</span> Nala mused to herself. <span class="mystic">"It is impossible to sever one from themselves forever."</span>

"It feels so crowded already. Are there more?"

<span class="mystic">"Certainly,"</span> Nala gestured towards the other doors and slots in the room. In total, there were nine: five filled, four vacant. The Mystic pointed towards their own door, crafted from solid night, adorned with gleaming stars, and a purple nebula that danced across its surface. A mist of rolling night clouds spilled onto the cobblestone tiles of Nala's sanctum.

<span class="mystic">"There were nine originally, but they are destined to evolve. They'll split and merge as your journey unfolds,"</span> explained The Mystic, nodding subtly. Nala observed her other selves: The Cruel, embodying her willpower; The Witch, her challenges; The Ally, her longing for love; and The Counselor, her empathetic acumen.

Nala gazed at The Mystic, the unasked question hanging between them.

The Mystic finally spoke, <span class="mystic">"I am your passions, your hobbies. You will understand in time. For now, you must awaken."</span>

<span class="mystic"><i>Nala's self-awareness deepens. Her intuitions will manifest more clearly when needed.</i></span>

<i>The Mystic is a <b><u>Core Fragment</u></b>. Core fragments are immutable, not occupying a slot, signifying Nala's growing self-comprehension. Other Fragments may evolve into Core Fragments.</i>

"So you nervous?" Chloe said, looking at Nala with a weak smile.

Crystal answered for Nala, "Pffft? This is the most powerful mage in the multiverse. Not a chance."

Nala had spent the better part of the morning vomitting out her nerves. She hadn't realized how much she had come to love her new home. The idea of demonstrating her magic, and possibly Jeopardizing that Was too much to bear. Though, Nala had always been able to clean up well, and quickly pulled herself together when Chloe and River had come to the door. Her <b>Janky Glamor</b> was sputtering in and out, occasionally making a silent fizzle or pop.

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally: Don't worry about it, you're going to do great,</i></span> she heard in her mind. She nodded with determination, she knew she had this.

<span class="counselor"><i>The Counselor: Are you sure about th—</i></span>

<span class="mystic"><i>The Mystic: Mind reader, remember?</i></span>

Nala shot a furtive glance at River who stared back at her with narrowed eyes. She couldn't help but give a small smirk and mirror their facial expression. They seemed far less amused then Nala was. Though it didn't really matter to her. If River was going to know how obsessive she was, she might as well let that red flag fly high and proud.

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch: Pointless, a bother at best.</i></span>

They were walking to the presentation area. The same path that they had ran into Tamil. The stone path winded around the grass, with colored lines from the academy leading to the different areas some labelled "Library," others labeled "Cafeteria," or lists of numbers for people trying to find a barracks, or instructors area. There was a large tree she had remembered, between them and the stage she was going to speak to the instructors at.

"Tamil!" Nala chirped with glee, waving.

Chloe and River looked at each other, and then back at Nala who was rushing ahead. They had sped up to a light jog to keep up. The moment was getting more tense, Nala had not bothered trying to hide that she had been planning something. Tamil smiled back and waved, and gave a quick jerk with her head over to a large container. She quickly whipped the box around, but still gentle with the contents.

"I have gifts!" Nala said, "I planned this with Tamil, and Crystal."

Chloe stopped, "... How have you been talking to Tamil? We've been watching you. You haven't sent letters, and you haven't left your room, we would know."

Before the thoughts could come into her mind, Nala reached into the box. She then pulled out a beautiful bushel of flowers in a sack for easy transfer. They had purple petals, and a green stamen. Their stems coiled, and eached looked similar to a french horn. Nala bit into her thumb, breaking the skin and drawing blood, dropping a few drops into the flowers pot.

It emanated beautiful music, whispering a song that no-one recognized. It was sad, yet triumphant and delicate. The music itself elicited feelings of a victory with heavy losses, or of love forged in war.

"What..." Chloe's eyes were wide, and she gasped. She cradled the flower like it was made of glass. "Nala... This is a..."

"It's a Weeping Warrior. I know yours died, so I got you a new one." Nala said, before digging through the box again.

"Wait, how did you know mine died? You've been locked in your room." Chloe didn't sound angry exactly, more astonished as she stared at the small flour. "How did you even get it? These only grow..."

"On your home-land? I'm very aware." Nala finished for her. Nala had pooled her resources with Tamil, who put the screws on Donnegan to make it happen. With Crystal's help, they had made it apparent that it would go a long way to making ammends with Nala. "I got you something as well River, don't worry."

If before River looked unammused, now they looked contemptuous. "Hmm." Their grunt was uncommital.

"Oh..." They said, as they saw what was in Nala's hand, "oh wow..." River's jaw didn't drop, but for a moment the placid facade fell away. Nala noted that they were beautiful, and became flustered when they made eye contact.

Nala had revealed the skulled needle in a glass casae. The dark rich mahogany seemed to almost absorb light. It had no shine, but there were light vines that she had carved around it, and then painted with magic. The dark wood hid the skull, so it looked as if it were floating. River seemed impress with just the beauty of it.

Then Nala touched the base, which had a few runes on it. The skull clacked in a rhythm, keeping a steady sequence of beats. River paused when they recognized it. "I know this—" They didn't sound amused, "I've been working on this... In private. With no-one around." They're face had gone back to annoyed. "No-one anywhere."

"I must have heard it through the walls." This was technically true, but it was more with her studies in Spellcraft, having spent most of her time focussing on it. She had learned to spy on either side of her room. Chloe told Tamil about the flower dying, and she had heard River trying to play their music alone in their room.

"The rooms are sound proofed." River bit out.

<span class="counselor"><i>The Counselor:</i> "They're sound resistant, that's not quite the same thing."</span> Nala said with a winning smile. Then, in her mind sent out, <span class="counselor"><i>Surprise, we've both invaded each other's privacy now!</i></span>

River snorted, but tried to hide a gentle blush.

"I get it," Tamil said, "If it's too creepy a gift, I can take it to Donnegan."

River quickly changed their tune holding the tiny construct to their chest, "Oh, uh... No that's fine."

<span class="counselor"><i>The Counselor: I knew they'd love it.</i></span>

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally: See? These are way better then a painting of yourself.</i></span>

<i>Marginally,</i> Nala thought, but she couldn't help but notice the joy the gifts brought them. Not only that, the subtle power play was delicious. She had reminded both of them that she was here because she wanted to be. A small tug on the dynamics that lets them know she is <i>choosing</i> to behave.

<span class="counselor"><i>The Counselor: Nala, you should know they are giving each other <b>very</b> concerned looks now. I think this may have been a bad idea.</i></span>

Nala didn't care, she held her head up high and proud, with a wicked smile as she stepped into the lecture hall. All nerves having left her with the success of the gift giving.

Her respite was brief

The room was both larger, and more full then she expected. She saw that there were a number of different color coats and badges. Noting that some were instructors, others were people she had seen around the town, and many were students. All eyes were on her.

She felt flush, a rush of warmth at being the center of attention again. This was her moment, she had it all but she was also panicking. Her eyes shimmered slightly, and her glamor started popping and whirring making her more self conscious. She was a ruler, a world-breaker, she had orated in front of millions, watched them kneel in worship.

In this moment though, she wasn't. She was lost, confused, and scared. She remembered that all those times, she had someone by her side. A partner who stood by her, that she knew would be by her no matter what. This wasn't just something she used to do, this was something she used to do wtih her dead husband. That wasn't the same thing, that wasn't the same thing at all. Beads of cold sweat formed on her forehead, as pit of lead dropped in her stomach and she felt woozy. She needed strength.

She felt the cold fire burgeoning from within, and steeled herself.

If this ever blows up in popularity later and people wonder why the mix-up, only one person voted and I just went with it instead of clarifying so that they'd still get mostly what they want. With the quest being very small in participation, it just seemed better to go with it. The update ended up being around 3 - 4k words anyways, and I realized it could hit 6 or 7k this update so I inserted a vote here so that "Do this without the Cruel" was still an option instead of flipping on it entirely, rolling a dice, or asking when I wanted to start writing at closing. I also didn't catch it when the vote happened.[/spoiler]
