[X] - "I've been obsessing over them. Like... dangerously so." Nala will reveal more of her obsessiveness.


[X] - Nala chose to "learn by doing," and took care of her own bandages. Then she spent time training with River while Chloe watched over Donnegan. (Gain Spelltheory: First Aid basics, I think I know what this does?), (Gain Spelltheory: Fighting basics, Combat Casting, Swords, and Pistols), and (Gain Bestiary, Touched by the Drakkenai) +2 bonding with River.

[X] - Nala pried a little, but also shared in return. (Ask River about wounds, Tell River about Mother)

The exciting turned to routine as Nala went about her tasks. Going to her work studies, learning odds and ends, meeting colorful characters, and then coming home. She quickly regained her independence, changing her own bandages, and working on herself. When Chloe would leave to watch Donnegan, there were long periods of time when she was alone to study. River had quickly suggested, most likely out of boredom, that they should start training. They, in their free time had apparently worked on setting up some sort of space or arrangement for the two of them.

River left Nala alone mostly, not mentioning what had happened the other night. When Nala had tried to talk, River would seem dismissive, always pointing to a later time being more appropriate. 

It had taken Nala a few hours to copy all of her notes from her pocket spellbook, into a large more secure one. These came with pages that already had running warding spells that kept the book from light damage and harm. Chloe explained at one point, that if Nala had been with one of the later waves it was one of the first jobs she would be doing. Writing wards to practice her handwriting, and producing spellbooks that students and citizens could use. Nala's handwriting was economical, neat, and compact. Using as few strokes to get as much on the page in the smallest amount of space. She only got better at that as she practiced.

She could also use special paper to copy from master archives spells directly within her book, making it unnecessary to know exactly how the spell worked in order to cast with it. Spell Craft seemed to be important, but not overly taxing mentally.

Though, as she went further into her late night studies, she realized it was difficuilt, but the difficuilties had been partially solved for her, allowing her to tackle more complicated problems. Many of the spells she copied from her pocket book were "Libraries," smaller spell building blocks that allowed her to skip much of the spellcrafting on her own. Her book could reference any other spell inside it, creating a network of casting that was both highly efficient, and complex.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: Spell Crafting with Libraries

The night before her presenting the Wisp spell came, and it was, like many of the other nights, uneventful. She had finished working on her spellbook with all of her current knowledge, and reached a point that she was happy with.

"Can I try to talk through this spell to you?" Nala asked her fox, Crystal. The fox had spent most of her time in the room napping, or occasionally asking for scritches and food when Nala's stress levels were high.

Crystal nodded in response, rousing slowly from a nap. Her paws slid across the blanket as she pulled herself into a long stretch. "Sure, lay it on me."

"Ok, so <i>Rot</i> right? It speeds up decay with magic. I don't really know how it works, and no-one here has a spell like it. It seems to use one of these universal runes. One we don't know, like the one that increments a count, or one of the few that means 'also' or 'and.' I thought it might have had something to do without catalysts, or possibly time."

Nala pointed at a symbol on the page, "The Rot spell is used by calling this, setting it to something and then incrementing after it."

"Alright, symbol of rot." Crystal said, scratching her ear with her hind leg.

"Yes, it is." She said excited, "It's one of The Witch's spells, you can't ever set it below zero or the whole thing breaks, but with enough energy you can instantly Rot something letting you quickly dry herbs, or meats. You can use it on a corpse to turn it into grave dust."

"Can you cast it on living things? Like age up a tree?"

Nala shook her head, "No, but I realized something, watch." Nala poured a bit of water into a cup, and then ran her finger down the spell she had written. The water almost instantly turned into a cloud. "I don't think it's causing it to decay. It's not a Rot spell, it's taking it's constituent parts and sending it out in the air. We can only see the water turn into a cloud because I cast the spell on it inside the jar. I could only do that because of this library over here."

Nala opened up to a seperate page, that had long lines of spellcraft in multicolored inks. "It lets you target via distance. Simplifies the targetting procedure to pointing."

Crystal nodded a few times then tilted her head, cocking it at an angle, "So how is this useful?"

In turn, Nala stopped, and puckered her lips, sitting in her chair at the scribe's desk in her room. "I haven't figured that out yet. I thought talking it through might reveal something." She shrugged, "I think I could probably write it on a flask to make a flask full of... Clouds? Fog in a bottle?"

"What uh... What's that in the corner there Nala?" Crystal said, her voice barely containing it's mirth.

"What?" Nala flicked the book back over to herself, and then let out a small gasp, "Goddamnit." She quickly made hand gestures over the page to erase a drawing that had taken up half of the other page.

It had been of Nala herself, great and beautiful, with someone far larger, and thicker in stature. She blushed furiously, whenever her mind wandered during spellcrafting inevitably parts of it would end up in her spellbook. Half the time she spent was simply erasing errant thoughts and pictures that had gotten transposed to the page. Not for the first time, she wondered if it would just be easier to do the writing by hand.

"That was a drawing."

"Shut it."

"What was that a drawing <i>of</i> exactly."

"<b>Shut it!</b>" Nala said with more force.

"Girl, how old are you? Are you seriously doodling in the margins like some — YIP." Crystal had to quickly tumble out of bed, to avoid the spellbook that had come hurtling at her. It slammed into the wall with a loud thud, and created a small smoking crater. The wall rippled as it began to heal again. "Violence can't solve all your problems."

With a growl, Nala replied, "I'm only looking for it to solve one," but she found herself laughing. They both knew that she would never actually hit Crystal, half the fun of the game was simply trying.

Then she groaned, "Everyone in this world walks around with a glamor, Crystal. They all wear meticulously crafted clothes, eat well, and are ridiculously athletic." She pinched the bridge of her nose as she flopped into bed, "What am I going to do?! How does anyone focus!? Every time one of those two do <i>anything.</i>" She shuddered.

"Oh my god, get a grip." Crystal laughed at Nala, and then hopped back onto the bed. "It's just proximity, and you're getting a little stir crazy."

"Crazy is correct." Pent-up aggression and frustration ached to be released, and now with her focussing on her spellbook constantly she was having trouble sleeping. She wanted to tear something apart with her teeth, and found herself chewing on her nails when unfocussed. A habit she thought she had put away years ago. If she left things in her hands, they would almost instantly become disassembled in her idleness. It was starting to get to be a <i>bit</i> much. "I am deeply regretting not appointing a new consort after Maldrake's death."

"You talk about your ex a lot you realize." Crystal said, "It's unseemly."

Nala gritted her teeth, and they started to crack and pop. "He's not my EX! You don't get <i>divorced</i> when your loved one dies." How did the Fox manage to get under her skin so easily, how did the most powerful sorcerer possibly in the multiversus now become eternally tormented by <i>feelings</i> and <i>mockery.</i> She unclenched her jaw and took a deep breath, "But... Yes, I think you might be right. I at least think about it too much for sure. I think I need to get all of this... nervous energy out of my system."

Crystal shrugged, "Sounds like you're ready to mingle with the general populace then."

"I would like to do more then mingle..."

Eventually, Nala drifted to sleep.

<hr></hr>

That night she had an odd dream, one where she was fully aware it was a dream, but had no control over it. She was again, on her chaise lounge but the empty void had shifted. She saw the same stack of books, same wine glass full of mead, same chamise lounge even, but now there were doors. What's more these doors seemed to ooze personality into the room.

<i>Personality?</i> Nala pushed the thought away as she looked around herself. Each door was different shaped, made of different material, and had different accoutrements. Small patches of ground, each different from the stone of the center where her lounge was, crawled out from the doorways. She stood up to inspect each door in turn.

The first door, was bright pink. It seemed to be made out of vertical slats of wood, and had been painted with flowers, and butterfiles. Everything was painted with light pastels, and gentle colors. The ground in front of it had cotton candy coming out, and the torches around it didn't have flames, but tiny fairy lights that flew in lazy circles.

The second, was wood in a steel frame. There was a metal plated bolt on the bottom, and a small glass window with chickenwire between two plates of glass. It wasn't cold, but neither was it warm. It simply was there, it existed, and somehow it seemed inviting and foreboding. Cold linoleum tapered to stone as the door's room transitioned to Nala's.

The next, was an iron vault door. Nala noticed it had a guard, a suit of armor with a spear. As she moved around the room the head of the guard followed her. It too had a stone floor, but its was rough, and jagged, while hers was smooth and paved. She felt sorry, for whatever must have been locked inside.

The Final door, she recognized instantly. It was the door to a Witch's sanctuary. A place of power that seemed to threaten you with it's essence. A place where dreams could be made or broken, sickness be healed or created. It had a small heart carved into the vertical logs, and it laid in a stone brick archway.

There were empty slots as well, in this liminal space. Quite a few in fact. As she absorbed the new parts of this place, she heard something click behind her, like a latch being undone.

Then she turned around, and saw herself. This one was like the various Nalas that were in the bubbles in the dream with the beast. The other Nala had long dreadlocks, and milky white eyes. There was a tug on her heart, and she realized this was a part of herself she loved, maybe even craved. She almost growled as the other Nala smiled and held her hands out for a hug. She realized she had been missing this powerful important fragment. That a crucial part of her, something she defined herself by had returned.

<span class="mystic"><b>(Gain voice, The Mystic)</b></span>

<span class="mystic"><i>The Mystic:</i> "And I suppose I make five,"</span> The Mystic said, her voice was low and gravelly, like a rumbling fire, or crackling coals. <span class="mystic">"We're going to be complete soon I suspect."</span>

"What?" She hadn't expected one of her fragments to speak so directly. The rest seemed just as confused as she was, but this one... This one had a certain confidence the others lacked.

<span class="mystic">"You have many facets, like any gem."</span> Nala said to herself, <span class="mystic">"It is impossible to sever one from themselves forever."</span>

"It feels so crowded already, there's more?"

<span class="mystic">"Of course,"</span> Nala waved her hand, at the other doors and slots in the room. There were nine in total, five filled, four that were not. The Mystic pointed at their own door, which was made of solid night, with gleaming stars, and a purple nebula dancing across it. A rolling night cloud seeped out onto the cobblestone tiles of Nala's sanctum.

<span class="mystic">"There were nine originally, but they will morph and change I'm sure. Splitting and combining as your journey continues."</span> The Mystic, gave a slight nod of her head, and Nala saw the other versions of herself. The Cruel who exemplified her will power, The Witch who exemplified her challenges, The Ally who exemplified her need to be loved, and The Counselor her clinical understanding of people.

Nala looked back to the Mystic, the question unspoken between them. 

The Mystic said, <span class="mystic">"You will deduce it later. It's time to wake up."</span>

<span class="mystic"><i>Nala gained a better understanding of herself. Her intuitions will now make themselves more directly known when appropriate.</i></span>

<i>The Mystic is a <b><u>Core Fragment</u></b>. Core fragments can not be changed, but do not take a slot. They are a sign of Nala's increasing ability to understand herself. Other Fragments can become Core Fragments.</i>

<b><i>Core Fragments</i></b> <i>can not be changed once they are chosen. When a new Core Fragment is acquired, that Core Fragment can be switched out.</i>

Switch The Mystic out for another to become a Core Fragment?

[ ] - No, The Mystic stays a Core Fragment.
[ ] - The Cruel becomes a Core Fragment.
[ ] - The Counselor becomes a Core Fragment.
[ ] - The Ally becomes a Core Fragment.
[ ] - The Witch becomes a Core Fragment.
