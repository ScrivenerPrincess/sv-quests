The excitement soon turned routine as Nala immersed herself in her daily tasks. She attended her work studies, absorbed various odds and ends, interacted with vibrant characters, and then returned home. Her independence swiftly returned; she managed her own bandages and focused on self-improvement. During Chloe's absences, when she watched over Donnegan, Nala found lengthy periods for solitary study. Bored, River quickly suggested they begin training. In their spare time, they had started preparing a space for their sessions.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: First Aid I: I think I understand what this does?

River mostly left Nala to herself, not addressing the events of the other day. When Nala attempted to discuss it, River appeared dismissive, always suggesting a later time would be more suitable.

Transferring her notes from the pocket spellbook to a larger, more secure version took Nala a few hours. This new book came with pages already enchanted with warding spells, protecting it from minor damage. Chloe once explained that if Nala had arrived with a later wave, one of her initial tasks would have been writing these wards, practicing her book weaving while producing spellbooks for students and citizens.

She also learned to use special paper, copying master archive spells directly into her book. This bypassed the need to fully understand a spell's mechanics for casting.

Many spells transferred from her pocket book were "Libraries," smaller spell components that circumvented much of the spellcrafting process. Her book now functioned as a casting network, highly efficient and intricately complex. As her late-night studies progressed, she discovered the inherent difficulties of Spellcrafting, while partially mitigated by prior solutions, still had it's own challenges. The Libraries sometimes caused more problems than they solved if not used carefully.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: Spellcrafting II: Crafting with Libraries

The night before her presentation of the Wisp spell arrived, uneventful as many before. Nala had completed her work on the spellbook, content with her current knowledge. Moreover, she had carved the final rune of her first project.

"Finally, I was worried I wouldn't have it ready by tomorrow," Nala remarked to Crystal. Her fox had spent most of her time in the room napping or occasionally seeking scritches and food when Nala seemed particularly stressed.

Crystal nodded, gradually rousing from her nap. She stretched, her paws sliding across the blanket. "Hmmm?"

"You know my Rot spell? It accelerates decay using magic. I don't completely grasp how it works, and no one here has anything like it. It seems to involve a universal rune, unfamiliar to us, similar to those that increment a count or signify 'also' or 'and.' At first, I thought it might be linked to catalysts, or maybe just the concept of rotting."

Nala gestured towards a symbol in her book. "The Rot spell functions by activating this symbol, designating a target, and then increasing its effect. It seems to have some relevance, though that's not the main point. The spell causes decay."

"Ok?" Crystal responded, scratching her ear with her hind leg in a casual manner. "You kind of just started explaining magic to me. Are you going to give me a second or..?"

"So I combined that rune with this," Nala said, her excitement evident ignoring the fox. In her hand, she held a small skull on the end of a needle. "It's not inducing decay. That rune is measuring time. I've used it alongside this library."

"Wait, can you send things through time? Can it age living things, like a tree? This is monumental, Nala, I—"

Nala shook her head. "No, I'm measuring time. Wait until I'm fini—" she replied, her annoyance growing.

"Is this what you've been experimenting with in your spellbook? Chronomancy?" asked Crystal, astonished.

"Crystal, No. Chronomancy isn't real. It's not Chronomancy; it doesn't manipulate time. That rune measures time. Look, I used it with this library." Nala turned to a page brimming with complex spellcraft in multicolored inks. "This section deals with constructs, making it easier to animate an object. Now, will you just watch?"

Nala gently touched the skull, then snapped her fingers in succession. The skull's jaws began to clack rhythmically in response.

Crystal nodded thoughtfully, tilting her head to one side. "So, how is this useful?"

Nala paused, her lips pursed in slight annoyance as she sat at the scribe's desk in her room. "Isn't it obvious?" she said, flipping the book open on the table. "It's akin to the hourglass spell, but it doesn't rely on reading weight or sand to function. It's quite precise." She placed the needle in a small, carved half-cylinder of wood, then covered the entire piece with a glass dome. After two sharp snaps of her fingers, the device ceased its activity.

"What's this in the corner here, Nala?" Crystal asked, her voice tinged with mirth.

"What?" Nala snatched the book back towards herself and gasped softly. "Goddamnit." She hastily made hand gestures over the page to erase a drawing that occupied half of the opposite page.

It depicted Nala, grand and beautiful, alongside a figure much larger and thicker in stature. She blushed intensely; her wandering mind during spellcrafting often resulted in parts of her thoughts being transcribed into her spellbook. Much of her time was spent erasing these unintended thoughts and images. She couldn't help but wonder if handwriting would be simpler.

"That was a drawing."

"Shut it."

"And what was that drawing [i]of[/i]?"

"[b]Shut it![/b]" Nala's voice carried more force.

"Girl, how old are you? Are you really doodling in the margins like some — YIP." Crystal had to dodge quickly to avoid the spellbook hurled at her. It hit the wall with a loud thud, leaving a small, smoking crater. The wall began to ripple as it healed. "Violence can't solve all your problems."

With a growl, Nala replied, "I'm only hoping it solves one."

"Man, what's with you today." Crystal asked. Normally it took a lot more to get a rise out of her.

Groaning, Nala replied, "Everyone in this world seems to be under a glamor, Crystal. They wear meticulously crafted clothes, eat well, and are ridiculously athletic." She pinched the bridge of her nose, flopping into bed. "What am I supposed to do? How does anyone stay focused? Every time one of those two does [i]anything[/i]..." She shuddered.

"Oh my god, get a grip," Crystal laughed, hopping back onto the bed. "You're just a bit stir crazy."

"Crazy is definitely the word." Nala was struggling with pent-up aggression and frustration. Her constant focus on her spellbook was disrupting her sleep. The urge to tear something apart was growing; she even found herself reverting to old habits like nail-biting. If she held anything in her hands, it would be disassembled in moments of idleness. "I'm starting to regret not finding a new consort after Maldrake's death."

"You do realize you talk about your ex a lot," Crystal observed. "It's unseemly."

Nala's teeth gritted, starting to crack and pop. "He's not my EX! A death doesn't equate to a [i]divorce[/i]." The ease with which the fox got under her skin was frustrating. How could she, once among the most powerful sorcerers, now be so tormented by [i]feelings[/i] and [i]mockery[/i]? She unclenched her jaw and took a deep breath. "But... you might be right. I do think about it too much. I need to release all this pent-up energy."

Crystal shrugged. "It sounds like you're ready to mingle with the general populace."

"I'm thinking of doing more than just mingling..." Nala glanced at the timepiece in her room, an hourglass connected to a small pile of dust forming numbers. "They must have swapped off. You should go."

"Are you sure you want me to continue spying on them?" Crystal asked as she hopped gently over to the window. "It's a massive invasion of their privacy."

"I'm just curious about what they do when I'm not around."

"Chloe gardens, River practices guitar. They don't seem to have much of a social life, to be honest. Both are always reading. I doubt I'll uncover anything new." Crystal's tone implied she was trying to reason with Nala, but Nala remained unmoved. She put the small boxed skull in a burlap sack and attached it to Crystal.

Nala shook her head. "I need to know everything. I don't like being in the dark. And, do you remember where to tell Tamil to wait?"

"Yes, we've discussed it a dozen times." Crystal rolled her eyes. "You do realize this will make you appear both insane [i]and[/i] dangerous, right?"

"Just go and do it," Nala said dismissively. She was glad that she had learned that River read minds, she had dealt with their kind before, and had managed to keep her secrets.

Crystal remarked, "Don't say I didn't warn you," and then departed. Meanwhile, Nala gradually drifted off to sleep.

[hr=3]

That night, Nala dreamed. She found herself on her chaise lounge, but the familiar void had grown and shifted. The usual stack of books, the wine glass full of mead, even the same chaise lounge were there, but now, there were doors. These doors radiated personality, filling the room with their distinct presence.

[i]Personality?[/i] Nala mused, pushing the thought aside as she surveyed her surroundings. Each door was uniquely shaped, constructed from different materials, and adorned with sconces. Extending from each doorway were different materials of floor, that comingled into the main chamber. Curiosity piqued, she stood to inspect each door in turn.

The first door was a bright pink, made of vertical wooden slats, painted with flowers and butterflies in light pastels and gentle hues. The ground in front of it sprouted cotton candy, and instead of flames, tiny fairy lights lazily circled the surrounding torches.

The second door combined wood and steel, featuring a metal-bolted bottom and a small glass window, reinforced with chicken wire. It exuded a neutral temperature, neither warm nor cold, radiating both invitation and foreboding. Cold linoleum melted into stone as it transitioned to Nala's area.

Next, she observed an iron vault door, guarded by an armored suit with a spear. As she moved, the guard's helmet seemed to follow her. Its stone floor was rough and jagged, contrasting with the smooth, paved surface of her own. She felt a pang of sympathy for whatever was confined behind it.

The final door was immediately recognizable to Nala as the entrance to a Witch's sanctuary, a realm of potent magic and possibilities. Carved into its vertical logs, within a stone brick archway, was a small heart.

Nala noticed empty slots too, many of them, in this liminal space. As she absorbed these new elements, a clicking sound, like a latch being undone, came from behind her.

Turning around, she saw another version of herself. This Nala, reminiscent of those in the bubbles from the dream with the beast, had long dreadlocks and milky white eyes. A tug at her heart revealed a deep connection; this was a part of herself she cherished, perhaps even yearned for. This other Nala smiled and extended her arms for a hug. Nala realized a vital fragment of her being, a defining element, had returned.

<span class="mystic"][b](Gain voice, The Mystic)[/b][/color]

<span class="mystic"][i]The Mystic:[/i] "And I suppose I make five,"[/color] said The Mystic, her voice low and gravelly, reminiscent of a rumbling fire or crackling coals. <span class="mystic"]"We're nearing completion, I suspect."[/color]

"What?" Nala was taken aback, not expecting such direct communication from one of her fragments. The rest seemed as bewildered as she was, but this one... This one exuded a confidence the others lacked.

<span class="mystic"]"You have many facets, like any gem,"[/color] Nala mused to herself. <span class="mystic"]"It is impossible to sever one from themselves forever."[/color]

"It feels so crowded already. Are there more?"

<span class="mystic"]"Certainly,"[/color] Nala gestured towards the other doors and slots in the room. In total, there were nine: five filled, four vacant. The Mystic pointed towards their own door, crafted from solid night, adorned with gleaming stars, and a purple nebula that danced across its surface. A mist of rolling night clouds spilled onto the cobblestone tiles of Nala's sanctum.

<span class="mystic"]"There were nine originally, but they are destined to evolve. They'll split and merge as your journey unfolds,"[/color] explained The Mystic, nodding subtly. Nala observed her other selves: The Cruel, embodying her willpower; The Witch, her challenges; The Ally, her longing for love; and The Counselor, her empathetic acumen.

Nala gazed at The Mystic, the unasked question hanging between them.

The Mystic finally spoke, <span class="mystic"]"I am your passions, your hobbies. You will understand in time. For now, you must awaken."[/color]

Whatever happened after that in her dreams, she did not remember.

[hr=3]

"So, you nervous?" Chloe asked, offering Nala a weak smile.

Crystal answered for Nala. "Pffft? The most powerful mage in the multiverse? Not a chance."

Nala had spent a good part of the morning battling nerves, her anxiety manifesting physically. She hadn't been able to keep food down. The thought of demonstrating her magic and potentially jeopardizing her newfound home was overwhelming. However, Nala had always been adept at composing herself under pressue. She quickly pulled together when Chloe and River arrived at her door.

Her [b]Janky Glamour[/b] however was betraying her with its intermittent sputtering, fizzles, and pops.

[color=#ffd6d6][i]The Ally: Don't worry, you're going to do great,[/i][/color] echoed in her mind. Nala nodded with newfound determination, confident in her abilities.

[color=#d5f0dd][i]The Counselor: Are you sure about th—[/i][/color]

<span class="mystic"][i]The Mystic: Mind reader, remember?[/i][/color]

Catching River's narrowed gaze, Nala offered a small, defiant smirk, mirroring their expression. Their lack of amusement didn't faze her. If River was to discover her obsessive nature, she figured she might as well embrace it fully. Let her red flag fly boldly above the waves, as it were.

[color=#dafaff][i]The Witch: This is completely pointless. You are painting a target on your back.[/i][/color]

They were on their way to the presentation area, following the same path where they had previously encountered Tamil. The stone pathway meandered through the grass, marked with colored lines from the academy leading to various destinations: some labeled "Library," others "Cafeteria," and some with lists of numbers directing to barracks or instructors' areas. Nala noticed a large tree, a familiar landmark, standing between them and the lecture hall where she was scheduled to address the instructors.

"Tamil!" Nala called out gleefully, waving.

Chloe and River exchanged glances, then looked back at Nala, who was eagerly hurrying ahead. They quickened their pace to a light jog to keep up. The atmosphere was charged with tension; Neither of them seemed to enjoy surprises. Tamil responded with a smile and a wave, then gestured towards a large container with a quick nod of her head. Nala deftly maneuvered the box, handling its contents with care.

"I have gifts!" Nala announced, "I orchestrated this with Tamil and Crystal."

Chloe came to a halt, a hint of confusion in her voice. "... How have you been communicating with Tamil? We've been monitoring you. You haven't sent any letters, and you haven't left your room. We would have known."

Before the thoughts could fully form in her mind, Nala reached into the box. She drew out a striking bushel of flowers nestled in a sack for easy transfer. The blooms featured purple petals and a green stamen, with stems that coiled elegantly, each resembling a French horn. Nala bit into her thumb, breaking the skin to draw blood, and let a few drops fall into the flower's pot.

A beautiful melody began to emanate from the flowers, whispering a song that was unfamiliar yet deeply moving. It sounded both sad and triumphant, delicate yet profound, evoking feelings of a bittersweet victory or love born amidst conflict.

"What..." Chloe's eyes widened in awe, and she gasped, carefully cradling the flower as if it were made of glass. "Nala... This is a..."

"It's a Weeping Warrior. I discovered yours died, so I got you a new one," Nala said, her hands already searching the box for another item.

"Wait, how did you know mine died? You've been secluded in your room." Chloe's tone was more of astonishment than anger as she gazed at the delicate flower. "And how did you even obtain it? These only grow..."

"On your home island? I'm well aware," Nala interjected, completing Chloe's thought. She had collaborated with Tamil, who had persuaded Donnegan to assist. With Crystal's input, they had emphasized how much this gesture would mean to Nala. "And don't worry, River, I've got something for you too."

If River appeared unamused before, now their expression had shifted to one of contempt. "Hmm," they grunted noncommittally.

Then, as they caught sight of what Nala held in her hand, their reaction softened. "Oh..." River murmured, a hint of awe breaking through their usually placid demeanor. "Oh, wow..." Though River's jaw didn't drop, for a fleeting moment their facade wavered. Nala noticed their beauty and felt a flutter of fluster when their eyes met.

In Nala's hand was the skulled needle encased in glass. The dark, rich mahogany seemed to swallow light, possessing no shine. Yet, it was adorned with delicately carved light vines, painted with magic. The dark wood cleverly concealed the needle holding the skull, making it appear to float. River seemed genuinely impressed by its artistry.

Nala gently touched the base, marked with a few runes. The skull inside began to clack rhythmically, maintaining a steady pattern of beats on an eight-count. River paused, recognition dawning. "I know this—" Their voice lost its amusement. "I've been working on this... in private. Alone." Their expression reverted to annoyance. "No one should have heard it."

"I must have picked it up through the walls," Nala suggested, her response technically true, though it was more due to her spellcraft studies. She had honed her ability to eavesdrop on either side of her room. Chloe had mentioned to Tamil about the flower's demise, and Nala had overheard River's solitary music sessions in their room.

"The rooms are soundproofed," River retorted sharply.

[color=#d5f0dd][i]The Counselor:[/i] "They're sound resistant, not soundproof; Two very different things."[/color] Nala said, flashing a winning smile. Then, in her mind, she broadcasted, [color=#d5f0dd][i]Surprise, we've both invaded each other's privacy now![/i][/color]

River snorted, attempting to conceal a blush that crept onto their cheeks.

"I get it," Tamil interjected, "If the gift feels too intrusive, I can return it to Donnegan."

River quickly revised their stance, clutching the tiny construct close to their chest. "No."

[color=#d5f0dd][i]The Counselor: I knew they'd love it.[/i][/color]

[color=#ffd6d6][i]The Ally: See? These gifts are much better than a painting of yourself.[/i][/color]

[i]Marginally,[/i] Nala mused internally, yet she couldn't deny the pleasure the gifts brought them. Moreover, she relished the shift in power dynamics. She had subtly reminded them that her presence was a choice, a deliberate act of will. That she was [i]choosing[/i] to behave.

[color=#d5f0dd][i]The Counselor: Nala, be aware they're exchanging [b]very[/b] concerned glances now. This might not have been the best idea.[/i][/color]

Unperturbed, Nala held her head high with a mischievous smile as she entered the lecture hall, her nerves dissipating with the success of her gift-giving.

Then, her confidence shattered.

The room was both larger and more crowded than she had anticipated. She observed an array of different colored coats and badges, distinguishing some as instructors, others as townsfolk, and many as students. All eyes were fixed on her.

Nala felt a rush of warmth, a flush of being the center of attention once again. This was her moment, her opportunity, yet beneath the surface, panic was brewing. Her eyes shimmered slightly, her glamour popping and whirring, heightening her self-consciousness. She had been a ruler, a world-breaker, commanding the adoration of millions.

But now, she felt lost, confused, and scared. She realized that in her past grandeur, she had always had the ability to lash out. Now, without threats of violence she found herself lost. Beads of cold sweat formed on her forehead, a heavy pit of dread settled in her stomach, and a wave of wooziness overcame her. She needed strength.

Summoning the cold fire within, Nala steeled herself for what was to come.
