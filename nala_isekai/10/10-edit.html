[X] - "I've been obsessing over them. Like... dangerously so." Nala will reveal more of her obsessiveness.


[X] - Nala chose to "learn by doing," and took care of her own bandages. Then she spent time training with River while Chloe watched over Donnegan. (Gain Spelltheory: First Aid basics, I think I know what this does?), (Gain Spelltheory: Fighting basics, Combat Casting, Swords, and Pistols), and (Gain Bestiary, Touched by the Drakkenai) +2 bonding with River.

[X] - Nala pried a little, but also shared in return. (Ask River about wounds, Tell River about Mother)

---

The excitement soon turned routine as Nala immersed herself in her daily tasks. She attended her work studies, absorbed various odds and ends, interacted with vibrant characters, and then returned home. Her independence swiftly returned; she managed her own bandages and focused on self-improvement. During Chloe's absences, when she watched over Donnegan, Nala found lengthy periods for solitary study. Bored, River quickly suggested they begin training. In their spare time, they had started preparing a space for their sessions.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: First Aid basics. I think I understand what this does?

River mostly left Nala to herself, not addressing the events of the other night. When Nala attempted to discuss it, River appeared dismissive, always suggesting a later time would be more suitable.

Transferring her notes from the pocket spellbook to a larger, more secure version took Nala a few hours. This new book came with pages already enchanted with warding spells, protecting it from minor damage. Chloe once explained that if Nala had arrived with a later wave, one of her initial tasks would have been writing these wards, practicing her handwriting while producing spellbooks for students and citizens. Nala's handwriting was efficient, tidy, and compact, maximizing space with minimal strokes. Her proficiency only improved with practice.

She also learned to use special paper, copying master archive spells directly into her book. This bypassed the need to fully understand a spell's mechanics for casting. While Spell Craft seemed crucial, it wasn't overly mentally taxing.

However, as her late-night studies progressed, she discovered the inherent difficulties, partially mitigated by prior solutions. This allowed her to confront more complex challenges. Many spells transferred from her pocket book were "Libraries," smaller spell components that circumvented much of the spellcrafting process. Her book now functioned as a casting network, highly efficient and intricately complex.

[X] - Gained Spelltheory: Spell Crafting with Libraries

The night before her presentation of the Wisp spell arrived, uneventful as many before. Nala had completed her work on the spellbook, content with her current knowledge. Moreover, she had penned the final line of a new spell.

"Finally, I was worried I wouldn't have it ready by tomorrow," Nala remarked to Crystal, her fox. Crystal had spent most of her time in the room napping or occasionally seeking scritches and food when Nala seemed particularly stressed.

Crystal nodded, gradually rousing from her nap. She stretched, her paws sliding across the blanket. "Hmmm?"

"You know my Rot spell? It accelerates decay using magic. I don't completely grasp how it works, and no one here has anything like it. It seems to involve a universal rune, unfamiliar to us, similar to those that increment a count or signify 'also' or 'and.' At first, I thought it might be linked to catalysts, or maybe just the concept of rotting."

Nala gestured towards a symbol in her book. "The Rot spell functions by activating this symbol, designating a target, and then increasing its effect. It seems to have some relevance, though that's not the main point. It causes decay, aging things, I believe."

"Ok?" Crystal responded, casually scratching her ear with her hind leg.

"So I used that rune with this," Nala replied, her excitement palpable. In her hand, she was holding a small skull on the end of the needle. "I don't think it's causing decay. It's not really a Rot spell; It does something with time, and space. I used it with this library."

"Wait, you can send things through time? Can it be cast on living things, like to age a tree? This is huge Nala I—"

Nala shook her head. "No, it's severely limited, and uses a great deal of energy to actually mess with it at all. Even drying herbs is mostly an emergency measure" She started to get annoyed.

"Wait, is this what you've been working on with your spellbook? Chronomancy?" Crystal was flabbergasted.

"Crystal, you're not listening. It's not Chronomancy, you can't manipulate time with it. Even the rot spell is mostly necrotic. Look I used it with this library." Nala flipped to a separate page filled with intricate spellcraft in multicolored inks. "This is for constructs, it makes it easier to animate an object. Watch the skull. Now will you just watch?"

She gently caressed the skull, and then snapped her fingers a few times in a row. The skull started to clack it's jaws in time as well.

Crystal nodded thoughtfully, then cocked her head to one side. "So, how is this useful?"

Nala paused, her lips pursed in thought as she sat at the scribe's desk in her room. "Isn't it obvious?" Nala threw the book open on the table. "It's like the hourglass spell, although it doesn't need to read weight or sand to work. It's pretty accurate." She put the needle in a small half-cyllinder of carved wood, before affixing a glass dome over the entire piece. Then she snapped twice, and it shut off.

"What's this in the corner here, Nala?" Crystal asked, her voice tinged with mirth.

"What?" Nala snatched the book back towards herself and gasped softly. "Goddamnit." She hastily made hand gestures over the page to erase a drawing that occupied half of the opposite page.

It depicted Nala, grand and beautiful, alongside a figure much larger and thicker in stature. She blushed intensely; her wandering mind during spellcrafting often resulted in parts of her thoughts being transcribed into her spellbook. Much of her time was spent erasing these unintended thoughts and images. She couldn't help but wonder if handwriting would be simpler.

"That was a drawing."

"Shut it."

"And what was that drawing <i>of</i>?"

"<b>Shut it!</b>" Nala's voice carried more force.

"Girl, how old are you? Are you really doodling in the margins like some — YIP." Crystal had to dodge quickly to avoid the spellbook hurled at her. It hit the wall with a loud thud, leaving a small, smoking crater. The wall began to ripple as it healed. "Violence can't solve all your problems."

With a growl, Nala replied, "I'm only hoping it solves one problem," but soon, she found herself laughing. The fun of their game was always in the mock attempts, never in actual aggression.

Groaning, she continued, "Everyone in this world seems to be under a glamor, Crystal. They wear meticulously crafted clothes, eat well, and are ridiculously athletic." She pinched the bridge of her nose, flopping into bed. "What am I supposed to do? How does anyone stay focused? Every time one of those two does <i>anything</i>..." She shuddered.

"Oh my god, get a grip," Crystal laughed, hopping back onto the bed. "You're just experiencing proximity effects, and it's making you stir crazy."

"Crazy is definitely the word." Nala was struggling with pent-up aggression and frustration. Her constant focus on her spellbook was disrupting her sleep. The urge to tear something apart was growing; she even found herself reverting to old habits like nail-biting. If she held anything in her hands, it would be disassembled in moments of idleness. "I'm starting to regret not finding a new consort after Maldrake's death."

"You do realize you talk about your ex a lot," Crystal observed. "It's unseemly."

Nala's teeth gritted, starting to crack and pop. "He's not my EX! A death doesn't equate to a <i>divorce</i>." The ease with which the fox got under her skin was frustrating. How could she, once among the most powerful sorcerers, now be so tormented by <i>feelings</i> and <i>mockery</i>? She unclenched her jaw and took a deep breath. "But... you might be right. I do think about it too much. I need to release all this pent-up energy."

Crystal shrugged. "Sounds like you're ready to interact with the general populace."

"I'm thinking of doing more than just mingling..."

Eventually, Nala drifted into sleep.

<hr></hr>

That night, Nala experienced a peculiar dream. She was distinctly aware it was a dream, yet she had no control over it. She found herself on her chaise lounge, but the familiar void had transformed. The usual stack of books, the wine glass full of mead, even the same chaise lounge were there, but now, there were doors. These doors radiated personality, filling the room with their distinct presence.

<i>Personality?</i> Nala mused, pushing the thought aside as she surveyed her surroundings. Each door was uniquely shaped, constructed from different materials, and adorned with various accessories. Ground patches, all differing from the stone center where her lounge lay, extended from each doorway. Curiosity piqued, she stood to inspect each door in turn.

The first door was a bright pink, made of vertical wooden slats, painted with flowers and butterflies in light pastels and gentle hues. The ground in front of it sprouted cotton candy, and instead of flames, tiny fairy lights lazily circled the surrounding torches.

The second door combined wood and steel, featuring a metal-bolted bottom and a small glass window, reinforced with chicken wire. It exuded a neutral temperature, neither warm nor cold, radiating both invitation and foreboding. Cold linoleum blended into stone as it transitioned to Nala's area.

Next, she observed an iron vault door, guarded by an armored suit with a spear. As she moved, the guard's helmet seemed to follow her. Its stone floor was rough and jagged, contrasting with the smooth, paved surface of her own. She felt a pang of sympathy for whatever was confined behind it.

The final door was immediately recognizable to Nala as the entrance to a Witch's sanctuary, a realm of potent magic and possibilities. Carved into its vertical logs, within a stone brick archway, was a small heart.

Nala noticed empty slots too, many of them, in this liminal space. As she absorbed these new elements, a clicking sound, like a latch being undone, came from behind her.

Turning around, she saw another version of herself. This Nala, reminiscent of those in the bubbles from the dream with the beast, had long dreadlocks and milky white eyes. A tug at her heart revealed a deep connection; this was a part of herself she cherished, perhaps even yearned for. A growl almost escaped her as this other Nala smiled and extended her arms for a hug. Nala realized a vital fragment of her being, a defining element, had returned.

<span class="mystic"><b>(Gain voice, The Mystic)</b></span>

<span class="mystic"><i>The Mystic:</i> "And I suppose I make five,"</span> said The Mystic, her voice low and gravelly, reminiscent of a rumbling fire or crackling coals. <span class="mystic">"We're nearing completion, I suspect."</span>

"What?" Nala was taken aback, not expecting such direct communication from one of her fragments. The rest seemed as bewildered as she was, but this one... This one exuded a confidence the others lacked.

<span class="mystic">"You have many facets, like any gem,"</span> Nala mused to herself. <span class="mystic">"It is impossible to sever one from themselves forever."</span>

"It feels so crowded already. Are there more?"

<span class="mystic">"Certainly,"</span> Nala gestured towards the other doors and slots in the room. In total, there were nine: five filled, four vacant. The Mystic pointed towards their own door, crafted from solid night, adorned with gleaming stars, and a purple nebula that danced across its surface. A mist of rolling night clouds spilled onto the cobblestone tiles of Nala's sanctum.

<span class="mystic">"There were nine originally, but they are destined to evolve. They'll split and merge as your journey unfolds,"</span> explained The Mystic, nodding subtly. Nala observed her other selves: The Cruel, embodying her willpower; The Witch, her challenges; The Ally, her longing for love; and The Counselor, her empathetic acumen.

Nala gazed at The Mystic, the unasked question hanging between them.

The Mystic finally spoke, <span class="mystic">"You will understand in time. For now, you must awaken."</span>

<span class="mystic"><i>Nala's self-awareness deepens. Her intuitions will manifest more clearly when needed.</i></span>

<i>The Mystic is a <b><u>Core Fragment</u></b>. Core fragments are immutable, not occupying a slot, signifying Nala's growing self-comprehension. Other Fragments may evolve into Core Fragments.</i>

<b><i>Core Fragments</i></b> <i>are permanent once chosen. Upon acquiring a new Core Fragment, it may replace an existing one.</i>
