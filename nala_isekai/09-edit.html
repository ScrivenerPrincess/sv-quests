[X] - "I care, but it's not something I'll fight over," Nala admitted, "I want to understand what's normal here, not punish someone who was mind-controlled by a monster." <Nala does blame Donnegan for what happened, but chooses to work with him.></Nala>

River regarded Nala with an unmistakable expression of respect. They acknowledged her decision with a nod before addressing Chloe, "She has made up her mind." They became gentle, and pulled out their book, "Here let me repair your uniform. Your sleeves are all burnt to shit."

They ran their fingers over a passage, and the jacket sewed itself back together. The drained from River's, and they paled from their normal vivid red, to a light pink.

Chloe seemed to want to argue, and also seemed bothered, but she didn't say anything else.

"Right now, it's not worth the hassle," Nala said. "I'm not happy about what transpired, but I won't stir trouble on my first day here." She felt a soft touch on her hind legs and turned to see Crystal indicating a desire to be picked up.

Nala hoisted the fox onto her shoulders, and the creature perched there, like a clumsy parrot. She had become surprisingly small and settled snugly into the curve of Nala's neck. Crystal yawned and then suggested, "Can we steer this conversation towards some chickens? Or mice? I'm extremely hungry."

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally: Honestly, we could eat too.</i></span>

"Hmm. Sure." River led the group through the city to a small wooden cart filled with half-moon pastries, emitting an aroma of baked dough and seafood. They ordered three, distributing the food promptly.

The pastry, known as a patty, tasted delectable. Stuffed with heavily spiced meats, it was hot and substantial, warming Nala to her bones. The heat rendered her tongue decadently numb. Realizing her ravenous appetite, heightened by constant walking and exertion, she devoured her first and eyed the stand with growing greed.

River quickly gave Chloe a nudge and handed her a small bag of coins, which she passed to Nala, saying, "This is your starting stipend. You would have received it during orientation."

The coins in the bag were silver, each side emblazoned with crossed swords on one and a dove on the other. They were heavy and ornate, seemingly crafted by some sort of magic press to be nearly identical. Eagerly, Nala traded a few coins for a pair of patties, finishing them just as Chloe and River completed their first.

[X] - Later, she asked, "Can we start today then?"

"So, if Donnegan is leading work studies, does that mean we're protectors now?" Nala queried once everyone, including Crystal, had finished eating.

"Yeah," River replied, "Do you have a spellbook? You'll need one." They opened theirs and tilted it towards Nala.

Nala, slightly confused, countered, "Couldn't I just cast it somatically?" However, upon seeing the book, she realized that was not feasible.

Casting it would require learning dozens of hand gestures over nearly half an hour. Moreover, the spellbook referenced other parts that had been stored and reused previously. Nala spent a couple of minutes just deciphering the complex glamour.

In that moment, she appreciated the time spent learning spell theory with Chloe and Tamil earlier. The fundamental building blocks enabled her to piece together the spell quickly and even consider its expansion.

<i>Spellcrafting I</i> &&
<span class="cruel"><i>[X] Scribbled Spellbook [Cr]</i></span>

Nala quickly fished out the small pocketbook from the day before and flipped through the scribbled pages. She was able to locate a spell very similar to the glamour, though it was incomplete.

Curiously, River looked over his book at the notebook and then pointed. "The spell on the back is for editing text."

Nala ran her fingers over the back of the notebook and focused. Tiny purple sparks of light traced over the ink, and the messy, scribbled scrawl seemed to straighten itself into impossibly neat and ornate handwriting. It was a tight cursive, without accent or flourishes. Many of the struck-out passages were moved, and the book itself seemed to rearrange as Nala focused on it.

While reading River's book, she managed to finish the spell, and then added the other spells she had learned that day. It had taken but a moment, though she started to feel peckish once again.

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i> With a quick toss of her palm, she completed the glamour. She thought of her coronation, the makeup, and a painting of herself the witch had commissioned before she had died.</span>

"You might want to transfer that to something more substantial, like a warded book, later," River said, but there was a warble in their voice. Nala wasn't sure what she had done to cause that reaction. Then she realized they weren't looking at her book; they were looking at <i>her</i>.

- [X] - <b>Spell Acquired - Minor Glamor</b>
- [X] - <b>Sustaining Spell - Minor Glamor</b>

<i>"Did you all do something?"</i> Nala asked, with a rictus grin on her face and her eyebrows wrinkling the center of her forehead.

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i></span> A harsh grumble crawled through Nala's mind. <span class="witch"><i>"Do not think too much of it, girl."</i></span>

Nala turned to Chloe, who gave her a warm smile. Meanwhile, Crystal giggled to herself quietly, her laughter reminiscent of a fox's bark.

Protector work, Nala soon found out, was rather boring. The following hours were spent meandering around the city and chatting. They chatted not only with each other but also with store clerks, money handlers, children, and people doing their daily tasks. Nala introduced herself more times than she could count and met more than twice as many people. She learned routes through the city and slowly became familiar with its layout and labels.

One of the people she met was Mr. Grayson, an elderly man who owned a farm just outside the gates. His hair was long, wavy, and bright pink like bubblegum. He spoke with a rural accent, and his hands were dry and cracked from working the earth. Nala was quite shocked to learn that he also <i>lived</i> outside the gates, where the Drakkenai seemed to roam. The three helped him load his cart with his remaining crops for the day to the Academy by the wharf. It was apparently a daily habit of Mr. Grayson's to donate whatever he hadn't sold — but would soon rot — to the students' cafeteria.

"Ah well, Ms. Nala, don't you worry about us none. Someone's gotta keep this town fed, hehah," he said. He carried a large tube, called a shotgun, an apparently extremely dangerous weapon. "Us Graysons, why, we've been taking care of Sabryna longer than Sabryna's been Sabryna. Hell, us Graysons were here before the first empire. Dating back to the first'uns."

Mr. Grayson had plenty of stories, some of which Chloe and River even confirmed as true.

It was a Grayson who had mapped every island, creating one of the first complete maps of the world. Though the map had long since been lost.

It was also a Grayson who had developed some of the first defenses the town used, acting as a backbone for the defensive shields during the New Moon.

When the first empire came to try and take their people, it was a Grayson who united the islands and defeated them.

And when the second empire surrendered, it was a Grayson who drafted the peace treaty.

"Hell, girl, it was the thirty-second Admiral, Karaboa Grayson, who first circumnavigated the globe! That's a history story for later though, I reckon. Thank you kindly for helping with the bags. Here, take a soursop." They had just finished loading everything into the kitchen, and Mr. Grayson gave them a warm goodbye. Before he left, he handed them a prickly green fruit. The insides were delicate, like a banana, and it tasted of intensely sweet-sour citrus.

Nala had learned that Sabryna was the name of both the island they were on and the nation. It had never been colonized — though not for lack of effort from their neighbors — and she discovered that Terra was an archipelagic world. Queenston and a handful of other surrounding islands that were part of the nation of Sabryna were called links. There were also dozens of sovereign states on Terra. However, as the third empire expanded, that number was quickly dwindling. People came to Sabryna because it was an open nation to all. Being always open, they had consistently stayed ahead of the curve scientifically. Those fleeing brutality brought their knowledge with them, and few who came to spy wished to leave.

"Some people call Sabryna the Siren nation," Chloe explained with a small laugh. "People come here lured by the calls of freedom, never to return."

River spat into the street. "Funny what happens when you treat people right."

<hr></hr>

After a delicious dinner in the cafeteria, the day soon came to a close.

[X] - Sabryna and World History: The Basics

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally: </i></span>Nala remembered, as the trio were winding down for the day, that she normally read before sleeping. She took a moment, before Chloe and River said goodbye, to ask one of them for a book.

[ ] Ask River to lend Nala a book - +1 Bonding with River.
[ ] Ask Chloe to lend Nala a book - +1 Bonding with Chloe.
[ ] Study the pocketbook - Add spell.


While she hadn't commented on it, Nala took note that the room across from hers had been emptied, and that Chloe and River's rooms had been moved to either side of her own. Though she knew it was not for her safety, there was something comforting about it after so much time alone.

However, it also served as a reminder that she was on a sort of probation and that she was being closely watched. When they were out, walking and talking, it was easy to forget. But the painful reality of her situation, flanked by guards, reminded her that she needed to be careful, and that Chloe and River might not have her best interests at heart.

Yet, when she rested on the bed with a book, she felt a change. The anxious thumping in her chest had subsided, replaced by a soft calmness.

[X] Spy on Chloe and Tamil's conversation.

Crystal had been pressing her ear to the door for the last hour and seemed satisfied with something. The fox quickly rushed over with an excited — but silent — yip, and started to regale Nala with what had happened between Chloe and Tamil.

"So Chloe and Tamil today... Do you really want to know?" Crystal asked, her rump wriggling in the air behind her, her pupils nearly swallowing her irises in excitement.

Nala rolled her eyes. "Yes, I want to know."

"Are you sure?!" Crystal goaded. "Once you know, there's no going back."

<span class="cruel"><i>The Cruel:</i></span> Nala grabbed a pillow from behind her and swung at the creature. With a small smile, she commanded the fox to speak, <span class="cruel">"Tell me, fox."</span>

"Alright, alright," Crystal laughed, leaping forward over the pillow. She landed on Nala's shoulders, resting her paws on Nala's head. Crystal's size seemed to adapt for the greatest amount of levity in the moment. "Chloe has been watching you with more than just caution on your recent walks."

"Oh, I'm so sure," Nala rolled her eyes, but her cheeks grew warm.

She wasn't entirely sure what she had expected the fox to say. She knew it <i>must</i> have been something along those lines; the signs seemed obvious. Nala flushed at the idea of being wanted in this new world, of being desired, especially after years of being feared. Of course, it would happen, but she allowed herself a moment of pride at it happening so swiftly.

"Now, remember not to think about that at all," Crystal said, mischief glinting in her eyes.

"Why shouldn't I think about it?" Nala replied, confused.

Crystal broke out into more manic giggles. "Because of the mind reader, one Mix River?"

Nala wanted to scream, "Oh my god, they know that:

[ ] - Every free moment today I've been gawking at my own glamour. <i>Nala will reveal more of her vanity.</i>
[ ] - I've been obsessing over them. Like... dangerously so. <i>Nala will reveal more of her obsessiveness.</i>

She fell back and let out a wail of despair. "Why did you tell me that?!"

"Careful with asking for forbidden knowledge. Man, I wonder how that makes them feel," Crystal said with a snicker, moving over to Nala's desk and staring at a large bottle. "That's gotta be awkward. They're both probably worried about how those kind of feelings would mix with the dynamic between all three of you."

Nala took a deep breath. "I guess it <i>is</i> rather inappropriate, given the power imbalance." She exhaled and then wanted to scream, "Wait, does that mean that River also knows about the Councilor's obsession?"

"Mmmhmmphf." Her affirmative was rather muffled, as Crystal's mouth was full with the glass handle of a bottle of brandy. She dragged it to Nala's hand.

Once the bottle reached her, Nala quickly took the cap off and started to chug. "How? How did I end up in this situation?! Why was I cursed with so much beauty?!"

<span class="ally"><i>"Be careful what you wish for, I suppose,"</i></span> Nala rubbed her eyes, remembering the little voices in her head. <span class="ally"><i>"You said you didn't want anyone to fear you, right?"</i></span>

<i>How in God's name did that translate to starting my own harem?!</i>

<span class="ally"><i>"Oh, come on, it's not that bad."</i></span>

<span class="cruel"><i>The Cruel:</i> "I rather like the strong one. She seems to have some grit."</span> With a wave of his hand, he gestured at the fox. <span class="cruel">"We should probably speak aloud for the creature's benefit."</span>

"Okay, what?" Nala took another swig. "Please explain."

<span class="cruel">"River..."</span> The Cruel paused, thinking, trying to choose his words very carefully. <span class="cruel">"Seems like a project."</span>

<span class="ally">"You <i>have</i> to know how awful that sounds."</span>

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i> "I would just like to remind you all,"</span> the Witch's bouncy, accented growl cut in. <span class="witch">"You do not actually have to make choices like this. Anyone who would be pursuing you while in charge of <i>watching you</i> would not be suitable as a partner."</span>

<span class="witch">"This is, in fact, a very bad thing. A very dangerous thing. Not something to cluck about like hens,"</span> she added, then took another big swig of the bottle. <span class="witch">"I know I have raised you better than this."</span>

The fox laughed. "Oh wow, you're nuts, aren't you?"

Deflated, Nala let out a defeated groan. "No, I'm not nuts, I'm cursed. It was part of the spell that sent me here."

"Cursed with what exactly?" Crystal asked, watching Nala with curiosity.

"Cursed to... Talk to myself. I guess. Memories, feelings, little chunks of me that broke off at some point. One's my mother, another is my intuition. I haven't figured out the other two, I've been distracted by..."

"Theys, gays, and flambés?" Crystal offered helpfully.

The bottle found its way to Nala's lips once again. "Has anyone told you you're <i>incredibly</i> vexing?"

"No, but I'm sure that conversation will be in my near future," the small creature trotted over to Nala, sitting just out of arm's reach. "Why'd you take off? I feel like being a Queen had to be better than catching fireballs with your face."

Nala went to take another swig, but the bottle was empty. She threw it haphazardly, letting the glass shatter into a magical receptacle. She winced at the crashing, rancorous din.

"My spouse had died, and I had never <i>wanted</i> to be a ruler. When that stupid overgrown lizard chose to kick the bucket, everyone assumed I had 'lost my edge.' I realized that if I stuck around, I'd end up fighting another dozen wars, but this time alone, for people I hated." She snorted. "I was planning to be a swamp witch like my mother, but I found a spell that promised something more."

"What do you mean 'chose to die'? You mean like..." The fox made a squishing noise and then dragged her paw across her own throat.

"No, not like that. We were sharing my time to keep him alive. I lied about it, and when he found out, he wanted to cut it off." She was blunt, trying to cut through the story as painlessly as possible. "In the end, I realized if I kept being stubborn, then I just wouldn't get to say goodbye. But after he was gone, I realized that being a goddess is pretty unapproachable."

Crystal snorted. "Wait, did you really leave because you thought you had become a god?"

"Yes, absolutely," Nala nodded. "Look at what I can do, the way I carry myself. I am beautiful, charismatic, powerful, capable of breaking not only cities or nations, but an entire world. What else would I be perceived as? Once most people know me, they can't help but worship."

The fox snorted, "So, do lots of gods in your world ask mommy to be less gentle?"

Nala swung at Crystal without warning, completely missing the fox as it leaped clear. Instead, she collided with the wall, leaving a softball-sized hole in it. They both fled from her small bed in panic. Black veins of ichor dripped from the wall to her nails, oozing like an infected wound. Both stared at the wall in horror.

"Oh <i>no</i>," Nala said, breathless.

The veins crawled inside the wall, eating away at it. Tiny bubbles of white plaster mixed with oily ichor started to pop and boil, foaming heavily. Both watched in silent horror as the hole grew larger and larger. River, in the adjacent room, whirled around in shock.

They shouted, "What did you <i>do!?</i>"

Nala froze in panic, her eyes locked on River. The back of her mind registered that there was more than just surprise affecting River's temperament. A litany of scars and healed wounds decorated the person's body: holes, old stitches, claw marks, and slashes. Some were covered by River's tight bandages wrapped around their chest, or clearly extending further into their breeches.

Before the wall had exploded, River had been changing the dressings on a wound. A ragged, bloody bite shone with blue blood against red skin.

The fact that Nala could <i>see</i> those scars, that wound, and the importance of decency took her longer than was appropriate to process.

"Sorry!" Nala locked eyes with the floor.

"Fix the goddamn wall!" River continued to yell. "What the fuck's wrong with you!"

<span class="witch"><i>The Witch:</i> The foolish girl stopped panicking, remembering she was a powerful sorceress, a witch of the wilds, and not a whimpering babe. With complicated gestures and a few muttered words, she started to banish the spell with ease. Then she gave herself time to think about her actions.</span>

The veins quickly receded, and the wall started to reform itself.

<span class="ally"><i>The Ally:</i></span> She heard River's door slam, and before the incredibly angry person could say or do whatever they had intended, Nala called out, "There was a spider on the wall! I panicked, didn't realize the spell was so strong! I'm still gathering my memories!"

The silence stretched out beneath her, and Nala's heart stopped. She winced as she waited to see if she would get a reply. Instead, she just heard River's door slam again.

Crystal turned to the young necromancer. "Nala?"

"Yes?"

"I don't want to make the same mistake twice. Did you just try to obliterate me for making fun of you and Chloe? Or for implying you might not be equivalent to divinity?"

"The uh... The latter. Reflex. Sorry." Nala cleared her throat. "I hadn't really thought about how I might react to that outside of my home."

"You may want to work on finding a healthier way to handle being teased," Crystal suggested, with a gulp. "So, you were an evil queen then?"

"Yes, well... Ahem. I'm sure some would say I was evil, but that's rumored about every head of state." She tried to smooth her naval uniform. "I wore a lot of black, raised the dead; people made assumptions."

Taking a deep breath, Nala moved herself to the bathroom to sip water from the sink. "I actually don't mind being mocked, outside of a few touchy subjects."

"Like... What?"

"Mmmmm... Don't make fun of my late partner, and the ah, the god jokes. I take that rather seriously. My nation was a theocracy. It's kind of a defense mechanism." The necromancer was now running her stinging hand under the faucet.

"What was the religion called?"

Nala winced. "Lenasm. The worship of the God-Queen Lena, and her dragon consort."

"Wow."

In a tone that almost seemed pleading, Nala added, "If it helps, the only tenets were 'Don't be cruel' and 'Don't raise an army.' Nothing— Nothing weird."

Crystal nodded in slow motion, their eyes wide and vacant as they stared at where the hole in the wall was. Meanwhile, Nala had been giving Crystal a weak smile in reassurance. They sat like that in awkward silence, when Crystal jerked, snapping out of their stupor.

"Oh!" Crystal yelped quickly. "Yeah, of course, that counts for loads. Bonus points AND kudos." Her tone dripped with sarcasm.

"Should I warn them? Tell the—" Nala started to say, but Crystal had already cut her off.

"No, you absolutely do not tell that to another soul," the fox said seriously. "You take that with you to your grave. When River catches your thoughts, we'll deal with it. People have weird intrusive thoughts all the time."

"Right." Nala gulped. "I'll... I'll watch my temper in the meantime."
